Since it's winter sale either way the game gets expensive every time a major update is added.

184002896,1229490,"Despite being an FPS game, this was very playable on controller. Since my computer sucks at running... well... anything, I decided to give this a try on my Steam Deck. I was surprised at how well the gameplay flowed on controller, even though I may have had some issues every now and then. Overall, my experience has been positive. I love the uniqueness of the story, and the wide array of weapons to choose from and enemies to fight. The soundtrack is definitely a banger, especially during bossfights. I did have a few controller-related issues though. First and foremost -- and probably the biggest issue for me -- is the whiplash. I could not get it to work for the life of me. I ended up spending hours searching through Reddit posts to figure out how it works, only to give up and rebind it to some other awkward button. The tutorial stated it's ""LB + RB"", but that did not work whatsoever. I ended up rebinding it to a button on the D-Pad, which is really awkward to hit because you have to let go of your left joystick (the one that controls the player's movement) to press it. I've barely used the whiplash since I've unlocked it. My second issue happened during the Leviathan bossfight. When you play on controller, the game enables an auto-aim feature that snaps your crosshair (but not your camera) to enemies that are already not too far from your crosshair. I love this feature, as it makes this game actually possible on controller. During the Leviathan bossfight, it would not snap to the boss. That's fine; the thing's big as fuck, so I don't need an auto-aim... especially when the boss is at the side. When I try to shoot the boss while it's doing the spinny-thing with its tail, my crosshair snaps to the whiplash orbs on each side of the arena. This makes me miss the boss 99% of the time during this attack, which frustrated me because it wasn't my fault. My final issue is the settings menu. It's laid out pretty decently, and looks clean too. The issue is I can't navigate it at all using a controller. I could edit the first few options, but every option below refused to be highlighted. Irritatingly, I had to use touchscreen to change them. I think Ultrakill shouldn't be deserving of a Steam Deck verified rating yet, not because it's bad (hell, I fucking love this game), but because of the issues I've had. If other games aren't verified because you ""need to use touchscreen to navigate a launcher"" or some other GUI, then I think Ultrakill should be demoted to playable too. This hasn't ruined my experience, but has just made it a little bit more irritating. Ultrakill is still really fun though. I'm addicted to the cyber grind, especially with the soundtrack that comes with it. The guest artists did a great work. I also love the customisability of the cyber grind. Importing your own textures is a great idea, and I spent ages tinkering with to make my cyber grind arena look cool. I've yet to beat Act 3, but what I've experienced so far has been really enjoyable. Go play Ultrakill. It's an experience to be had on your own, so don't spoil yourself and play it immediately. Trust me, you'll become addicted like me.",2024-12-28 16:21:59,27.78,True,0,0,0,False,True,

184039514,1229490,"I heavily love this game's combat and movement system, it's one of the best one's that I've ever played but, that's as much praise I'll give it. I only play this game for that reason only because of it's use of religion towards the christian church. If you don't really don't care all that much about it then go for it and buy the game but, if you're into the lore and you're a christian, it'll most likely bug you. It's heavy use of religious poses, almost seeming like it's mocking them, and having St. Gabriel become this sort of fallen angel doesn't sit right with me. Especially the Idol's which protects certain enemy's, in hell btw, being a exact reference towards The Immaculate Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus. Call me weird but I don't care, but when I saw that, I couldn't take it open me to destroy it and progressing forward. Over all, the story of Ultrakill seems very blasphemous, which can ruin the game for some people. I would only recommend the game only for it's movement and it's combat system, but not it's story. Though, all of that being said, I mean no hate towards the developers of the game, and I also love the music as well, it's one heck of a banger to listen to, it's just the story that bugs me; that's just my opinion though.",2024-12-28 23:07:24,4.38,False,3,2,0.4,True,True,

143929127,266410,"I have been on iRacing for 10 years coming up and I have to say it is one of the best decisions I made in terms of gaming. This has turned into a complete hobby for 8 years now. While there are other simulators available which are great and bring to the table better graphics and a few other features, iRacing is the full package. While cost is definitely the first thing that was on my mind when I started, I personally feel that it has never been easier to get into cost-wise. Unless you see yourself rising through the ranks quickly, you really won't be likely to purchase any additional content for the first 3-6 months. This would also be my recommendation. Multiplayer is the reason to be on iRacing. There is no better sim out there when it comes to multiplayer. That is because the community and iRacing police this. The protest system will boot those making the experience tough on other competitors. As you race among the same people, you will begin to respect and be respected by your peers. (For instance, my team will go against the same team in endurance races a couple times a year). While racing can be unforgiving of mistakes, understanding that mistakes happen is part of racing. If you dont desire racing against real people, iRacing probably won't be for you. However, you will miss out on true grit racing and testing yourself against equally skilled racers. I am a big advocate for iRacing and I feel that this review is overdue considering I only connected steam 5 years ago (Hours should be doubled).

There are other categories like GR Cup which sometimes brings paid tracks. If you decide to invest on this category, be aware that you will fight the devil for ever. People often will take you out of the race by commiting mistakes or even intentionally. You can raise a protest, there is a cool down time after the race to make you forget and move on but if you really want to proceed and protest be aware they will just send you a standard response saying they didnt see nothing intentional in the incident.

Find that vehicle and see if there are current race series going on, not all cars have events running. Then look at the track schedule for the event this will show you what tracks the event will race at, so you can clearly see what you would need to participate in all events for that car for the season.

148895896,266410,"I'm going to start with what a lot of people have issues with, and that's the price. iRacing is a great game, the pricing, however, is extortionate. Now you might be thinking that $20/month isn't so bad, and you would be right, it isn't. The problem is, that £8.99/month only gets you access to the Rookie series. Thereafter, you have to pay $11.95 per car and $14.95 per track. You do not need all of the cars and tracks but, using the GT3 series as an example, so for me to participate in this seasons GT3 series, I would need to at minimum, buy one qualifying car for $11.95 and 12 tracks at $14.95 each ($179.40). And that's just for one series, if you want to participate in more than one, add another $11.95 for the car and $14.95 for tracks you haven't purchased yet. As you can see, it does get expensive, however, you can spread the cost out as it's one track per week for each series. With that said, despite the fact that it pisses me off you need BOTH a subscription AND need to buy cars and tracks seperately, I would still recommend iRacing - though, only if you enjoy multiplayer. iRacing is by far the best multiplayer racing sim available. Races run at set times every hour and I've found there are always people racing. You'll have to ignore the Steam statistics as the majority of people use iRacing outside of Steam. You have a safety rating and iRating which promotes clean racing and you will be matched with racers with similar skill level to you. It's great for multiplayer racing but as above, it's just unfortunate you have to pay for literally everything outside of Rookies at $11.95 and $14.95 a pop. It gets cheaper long term as you no longer need to keep buying cars and tracks because you've already gone bankrupt by purchasing them all. It is an extremely fun game though... Edit: It's actually worse than above... iRacing charge tax at checkout instead of including it into the display price. So your $11.95 car becomes $14.34 and $14.95 tracks become $17.94. As if paying for a subscription and paying for the content isn't extortionate enough, they slap you in the face at the end with tax.

Every morning, the anticipation would build as we drove to my aunt's house, where I'd spend the day while he worked. But what made those days truly unforgettable was the thrill of immersing myself in Age of Empires II. At 6:00 am, I'd dash to my cousins' room, boot up their computer, and slide in that iconic game CD. The next several hours would fly by as I built empires, strategized battles, and navigated the richly detailed world of medieval history. Age of Empires II wasn't just a game; it was a gateway to a world where I could control knights, castles, and civilizations, all while learning about history in the most entertaining way possible. Replayability was endless. Every match offered new challenges, whether I was perfecting my strategy against the AI or conquering the campaign. Even after spending entire days engrossed, I'd come back the next morning with the same excitement. It wasn’t just the gameplay—it was the music, the atmosphere, and the joy of mastering the mechanics that made it an unforgettable part of my childhood. Age of Empires II isn't just a game for me; it's a cherished memory of simpler times, of family, and of endless possibilities.

183025436,813780,"I grew up playing AOE I and while AOE II is similar enough, it took me a bit to learn about all the new changes that came with it. Thankfully, it didn't take long for me to enjoy huge amount of campaigns you get for this game and that's before I got all the DLC. If you're into multiplayer, there's a lot there as well with loads of maps and civilizations to choose from. The barrier to entry for multiplayer is high, but an advanced tutorial can help you learn proper build orders and unit counters. Over the years, they've updated this game a ton. Everything looks less pixelated than the HD edition and the animations have been improved, especially when buildings get destroyed. The civs still get updated to make them more viable in multiplayer and while not all of it works, it's commendable that they're still trying even up to the date of this review. The accessibility and options are also great, though playing with a controller is still pretty limited compared to keyboard and mouse. The only big issues I have are that the pathing AI is still not great as units tend to stick to each other or get stuck against objects while in tight spots. And while the AI is better than before, there are instances where you can easily cheese it with a well placed castle or using ships to fire at melee units as they flail around. Finally, as mentioned before, the multiplayer is fun, but also very daunting if you want to get into the meta as there's 20 years worth of experienced knowledge that a newbie will have to know to ensure they don't get decimated. Overall though, it's fun to play whether you go solo or multi. The two are practically different games where one is a chill history lesson and the other is a fast-paced war. And now that the first three DLC are free, there's way more content than ever. Give it a shot.",2024-12-18 07:41:50,1080.2,True,0,0,0,False,False,

134557234,2060130,"This is a game where I feel there is a button missing between approve or disapprove. After a long thought I simply cannot recommend this game despite nostalgic feelings and good old funky theme. I am a big fan of the franchise and the game did deliver some of that feeling... but it also made me sure that I was indeed the targeted audience upon which to profit from. So, kudos to the marketing team of the game: well done, you got me, as you probably got others. Regarding the game, after the initial spark and a smile here and there, the game quickly becomes a tedious walk between very limited amount of locations. It looks like a modern cheap ripoff of the Monkey Island 1 where the designer team was simply too lazy to invest time and effort for any kind of creativity. The ""puzzles"" are so lame that they would insult the intelligence of an average monkey (pun indented). The addition of the hint book simply adds salt to the wound. I understand that the times have changed dear devs, and that an average gamer needs a quest marker, compass, visual and hearing aid as well as a 10 hour tutorial and a crutch to move forward but IF YOU ARE CREATING A GAME TARGETED FOR THE OLD HAGS AND VETERANS IN THEIR 40ties or 50ties DO NOT INSULT THEM.

162569230,2060130,"I wholeheartedly recommend this game, even for people without any nostalgia for adventure games. Personally, I have fond memories of playing The Secret of Monkey Island as a 7-year-old in the attic of a friend’s place. We never made it far, but the images of the lookout, the town, the circus and the cardboard pirate wheel are burnt in my brain forever. When I got older, adventure games could never capture my interest again. I was mostly frustrated with puzzles that needed a specific solution while the space of theoretically possible solutions was infinite. In the end, I came around after watching the noclip documentary on Return to Monkey Island’s development. The developers really put all their love into this game, and it shows. I love the non-conformist graphics style. It contributes something new and doesn’t only wallow in pixel nostalgia. I love all the variety of dialogue options, delivering multiple punchlines at once. Often the puzzles themselves are like a dialogue with the developers, tempting them by trying outrageous things and smiling when it turns out to be something that they considered. I love all the meta components, also the ending. Shutting the theme park down made me surprisingly emotional about leaving this world. And in the end, I’m really thankful for the modernizations compared to the original. Looking in the hint book from time to time didn’t break the immersion as does looking up hints on the internet or starting a vicious cycle of angrily trying out all theoretical combinations. And I’m unsure if I just imagined it, but did I get a recap when I came back to the game after a week?",2024-04-09 21:56:18,11.97,True,4,0,0.54,False,False,

164650041,2060130,"I hope Ron Gilbert gets blacklisted and never is allowed anywhere near a game engine again. EDIT: Went back and gave it a second chance. I'm 114 laugh-free minutes in. This is really painful. It's nostalgia bait with callbacks that aren't enjoyable. The art is uglier than the staff of Kotaku. Every returning voice actor sounds like they don't want to be there, as every line comes off with a feeling of exhaustion. The new actors are 90% female and have that air of hipster smugness due to being in a le heckin' retro oldschool classic. Most of the puzzles are just running back and forth between two locations for events to trigger, and any that require any actual problem solving are incredibly obvious. If a book has been written on how to dig up the corpse of a video game series and then defile it with no lubricants, the development team has memorized it. There are no redeeming qualities about this game. It's THAT FUCKING BAD. I haven't played Tales (I have it on my account because I impulsively buy games on sale), but there's no way it can be this bad. This feels spiteful (which makes sense, because Ron Gilbert always hated the fact that Curse was the best game, and it retconned his stupid ending from 2), like The Last Jedi of adventure games. Escape was a bad game, but it at least felt like they WANTED to do something good (and it had hits as well as its more frequent misses). This feels like an angry letter to fans for enjoying Curse.

156482039,2060130,"I recommend this game because at its core it is a good game and if you are a monkey island fan, of course you should play it. As a long time monkey island fan though I was disappointed especially after having high expectations after Thimbleweed Park which is an INCREDIBLE game (70 hours playing TP, 7 playing RMI). This review will share those feelings in case other people might feel the same way. For the good, it is still monkey island and the overall cast and feel is what you would generally want from Monkey Island and an adventure game. I appreciate the art style as an attempt to do something new and different. There are no puzzles that really stood out or that I had a lot of fun with. I got to a point late in the game where I realized the solution to a puzzle was so obvious and required so much backtracking to pick up a particular item that I just stopped playing - I was not motivated to do what the game wanted me to do. This game is also in the tough situation of wanting to acknowledge its roots but also look ahead. The result however is that revisiting locations from past games is simply not interesting or exciting. You’re on Monkey Island for about five minutes and that’s it. This is also how I felt at many of the new locations in the game - there was not the sense of meaningful exploration and investment in an area that you had in past games. The result is you hop from place to place doing minor puzzles here and there. Another minor gripe I have is the relationship between Guybrush and Elaine is very lovey-dovey. This is a woman who would give Guybrush hell even after they got together so it’s weird to see her fawning over him, and it became another thing that didn’t feel quite right. Maybe I need to play it again but ultimately a disappointing experience given the high expectations I had and the long-time hope of a new Ron Gilbert monkey island game.",2024-01-21 16:58:41,6.92,True,0,0,0,False,False,

Guybrush is irredeemable, He's a legitimate sociopath in this. And crow is never once on the menu. He gets forgiven offhand after basically sentencing a beloved character to hellish torture and stealing his possessions. I can't endorse a Monkey Island game that makes me despise the main character the entire time I'm playing. A few moments of self-awareness are instantly washed over with narrative dissonance in a way that undercuts any empathy for the characters. Guybrush just SUCKS as a person in this game. He's awful.

152622885,2060130,"I'm a lifelong Monkey Island fan and was SOOO excited to hear that some original team members were coming back to make this. But I shouldn't have been. It's just not good. ART - This is good. I had no complaints here. It's charming! PUZZLES - They were good! Satisfying, challenging, and balanced. They start a little overly easy for someone experienced at point-and-clicks like this, but I figured that was by design, so newcomers to the series could jump in since it was getting a lot of hype. The pacing is odd but fine. DESIGN - A little empty. Gone are the days of combining random things or showing items to NPCs to get unique lines or jokes. Most things have only 1 or 2 possible ways to interact, and a lot of the maps and scenes are just empty. VOICE ACTING - Fine. Some sound a little out of character but having Dominic Armato makes it all OK to me. He's wonderful as always. STORY - Waste of time. It was self-indulgent, pretentious, and soulless. The game feels unfinished. They explain in a post-game letter that this was essentially a mid-life crisis work slash series farewell and it's meant to be disappointing and hollow-- but if you don't know how to write an ending, just admit it. I used this game to introduce Monkey Island to someone new to the series and fully regret it. It's just a disingenuous and bitter-feeling approach to the series that leaves (by design) a sour and tired taste in your mouth.

I finished it in just 6 hours. - The atmosphere and musics are too calm and not as expressive as ""Curse of Monkey Island"". - There are no big happening within the story or stressful puzzle where timing is crucial for example. - I could not find the rubber chicken and the pulley...!? - There is not a single monkey in the game...",2023-04-30 16:48:16,5.35,True,0,0,0.5,False,False,

152945917,2060130,"I have mixed feelings about this game. The two writers have a good grasp on the kind of characters that should populate the world of Monkey Island, and indeed -if you're a fan of the series- you'll find your most beloved ones here just like you remember them, with a lot of the newcomers being funny and charming as well (LeChuck's crew stands out in this regard). The overarching plot, however, is another matter. There's quite a few minor plot points that go nowhere, and the overall story in general ends... not as unexpectedly as one would've hoped. Until the ending though, it's a decent enough plot, not too far off from the other games. The dialogue is solid too, doesn't reach the heights of the first three but it never sinks too low either. In this department the voice actors delivered: LeChuck's new one did a fine job, Guybrush's is as good as ever and kudos to Murray's for knocking it outta the park. The problems with the game lie elsewhere, namely: the art. It's better in motion than what you've seen in the screenshots, but it's still a far cry from how the previous chapters handled it. It's a pity, because the idea behind some locations are interesting (like Terror Island), and it makes you wonder how they would've been with a better style. For better or for worse, Guybrush is the worst design-wise, none of the other characters are as ugly. Another problem with the game is its gameplay. Due to how the interface is structured it's way, way too easy, even on its hardest difficulty. The new interface also limits the possibilities of funny dialogue and interactions the previous games offered. It really makes it less fun than what it could've been. So, why am I giving it a positive evaluation? Because I'm a long-time fan of the saga and I never thought I'd see another Monkey Island by Ron Gilbert, namely the one that would finally ""reveal"" the Secret. On top of that, the fact that he didn't de-canonize all the other games after the second like he originally planned, but instead kept his new one in continuity with them and even paid homage to them (save for a huge, unexplained retcon that however brought back a beloved character) makes for an even bigger surprise, because it goes against most if not all of what he had planned for his third Monkey Island. He even kept the romance between Guybrush and Elaine, ain't that sweet. I hate loose ends, I don't like retcons and, few exceptions aside, this is a game that concludes the whole saga without disregarding what came before, made by its original author. It's not like I hoped it would be, it's not perfect or even excellent, but I'm still glad it exists.",2023-12-05 20:05:38,51.35,True,33,1,0.8,False,False,

Only things I am not crazy about is the art style for the characters kinda wished it was like curse of monkey island or escape. And am not really keen on whoever is voicing Lechuck I know the original actor retired but still couldn't he have come out of retirement just to voice Lechuck one more time if he was passionate about his character you would think he would right anyway just didn't find the replacement very scary or commanding as the original actor other than that I am enjoying the game.

Maybe that's because the humour, heart, and message are also impeccable: exactly the kind I remember from playing/watching my brother play these games when I was a child/teenager. It did not overstay its welcome, being a little shorter than I remember the others being.

The hint book is a useful addition if you want to make steady progress and not get stuck on obstacles for too long.

Almost all the voice actors are back doing what they do best (Dominic Armato remains amazing as Guybrush), and the soundtrack stays true to what you'd expect. I, like many others, was shocked when I first saw the new artstyle, but I soon grew accustomed to it as I played. Puzzles aren't quite as difficult as other games. There were only a couple I had much difficulty with, but part of that can be explained by the fact that if you can't use an item on another one, it just won't let you, and I don't recall any ""Moon Logic"" puzzles. There's also a hint book in the game if you get stuck, which appears to be there because someone who truly wants the answer without figuring it out would just look up a walkthrough. With all that being said... it's not perfect. Insult sword fighting, a staple of the franchise, is almost nonexistent. There are also trivia cards to test your knowledge of the game series, but they're randomly scattered around and have to respawn (and will only do so if you've been answering them), and if you want to get the achievement for answering them all, you're going to end up walking back and forth and loading saves to get them.

147158349,2060130,"This one is great! A worthy successor to the series. The art style might look off-putting at first but it is handeled and animated really well. 30 minutes into the game and you will probably learn to appreciate that. The puzzles are actually fair, not to easy but not completely bonkers logic defying bullshit. It might take the fanservice a bit too far, especially with regards to the first game but that didn't bother me. Speaking of which, it really leans heavily towards the very first game in terms of inspiration. This becomes obvious from the very start as the scrapbook that tells the story so far dedicates 3 pages towards the first game and one page each for the other games. I just wasn't sure on how to feel about the ending at first as it was a bit abrupt and left a lot of things unanswered, but thinking about it for a long time and the true secret of monkey island (yep, they actually reveal it this time) it all makes sense to me, but due to spoilers this is where I will stop talking about this. Obviously after 30 years of teasing not everyone is gonna be happy with how the franchise is coming to an (possible?) end but at the end of the day every player has to judge that for themself. To sum it up, it's brilliant to get a game that is easily offering as much content as the old monkey island games, while having a production value that feels contemporary all for like half the price of a blockbuster game back then. Also it's is much much better than Timbleweed Park.",2023-09-27 21:08:48,7.08,True,0,0,0,False,False,

I was already playing some Maniac Mansion and then i saw this game. What a feeling...what a music...facing an evil ghost spirit pirate LeChuck. Arrrrgggh :P The game of Return to Monkey Island was really really very good. Connected so much about the past. Really well done guys! I played it with my father and i saw him with tears. Haha i was so pissed about the T-Shirt again being the secret but i guess its just fair for the story and franchise.

This is nowhere near as good as the first two classic games for many different reasons, explained very well by the creators within the notes of the game.

It's like they say, you can never go back home. Neighbors have moved or died, businesses have closed or been remodeled to the point of being unrecognizable, the atmosphere is... different.

154892447,2060130,"[h1]One GLARING issue aside, a good entry into the series.[/h1] TLDR: The artsyle is atrocious, the game's good otherwise. I was introduced to the Monkey Island series through means of Curse of Monkey Island, third entry into the series and a phenomenal game. Later I tried the original MI2 with DOSBox support, but found it less than ideal. The remakes of MI1+2 were good games, Escape from Monkey Island and Tales from Monkey Island repulsed me though. Return to Monkey Island... tbh? I really, really loathe the artstyle. It looks as if some of the worst animation ideas of the last two decades were blended into this atrocious artstyle. Thankfully the story and the humour are good enough to be enjoyable, with a lot of references/cameo's and so forth to prior games. Unfortunately there's a limited amount of things you can do in game with the different items you collect, which is a little sad. But with the series creator involved that's something you can look beyond hopefully. [b]To buy or not to buy?[/b] TBH, aside from the grotesque artstyle and the weak beginning it is a good game. Mostly a trip down memory lane for MI fans, but with enough for those not familiar with the series to enjoy it too.

This game also manages to masterfully encourage exploration and experimentation, weaving your unique set of decisions into it's own unique, but cohesive, experience! This game has had a lasting impact on me, and I'm looking forward to playing this again and seeing what other stories I can uncover! What are the things that I like about this game? [list] [*]Fantastic presentation! From the beginning, the fully voice-acted narration, the pencil-drawn scenes, and the subtle score all create an incredible atmosphere which definitely got me invested in the story from the get-go. In particular, I wasn't entirely sure about the voice-acted narration at first, since I tend to be the sort of person to try and read through dialogue as fast as possible, but I would say that the narration is some of the best parts of this game. It really helps build the characters and the various scenes you find yourself in. [*]Unravelling the story is very fun and enjoyable! You'll start off the game with many questions, and the game's pacing does a great job at ""breadcrumbing"" answers to you. As you have more conversations and encounters, you'll start building up your own understanding of the world and what's happening in it. I really enjoy that it feels quite open-ended also! There's a lot of room for interpretation at every step. [*]Content-dense and lots of replay value! This game can be as short or as long as you'd like it to be, which I think is great! I finished my first run in about 3 hours, which felt like a good pace for me, but I know there are many other routes I could have explored. I get the impression that there's WAY more to see in this game than what I experienced, and I'm really looking forward to digging in more. [/list] Who would I recommend this game to?

182795756,1989270,"It has long been my belief that art exists, fundamentally, to make you feel things. This game is art. It is perhaps one of the most ambitious artistic masterpiece I have ever seen in the video game medium. Why? Because it doesn't strive to evoke just one feeling. It runs the gamut and succeeds masterfully. It manipulates you, and even though you know that it is doing it, it still pulls it off. This is not your standard visual novel. It genuinely barely deserves the label. There is no particularly intricate plot. The only time you get long, tedious info dumps is if you go looking for them and constantly choose every conversation option that isn't a decision. This game is really just a series of conversations with yourself and two other people. And then? And then you have to *decide*. What do you believe? Who do you trust? What morals do you value? I'll try to be vague because this is genuinely a game that will be better the first time without spoilers, but everything after this paragraph might potentially be a little spoilery. Before I lose some of you though, make sure you check the game's options. You can turn off certain sound effects if you think they'll be too visceral. This game is a complex web of choices that all matter. From an initial three-ish decisions the game branches into at least 10 primary routes that are all radically different. The slightest deviation in your conversation choices, even apparently innocuous ones, can put you somewhere completely different. And those routes can branch into others too. And all of the paths make sense. Very, very rarely, if ever, will you look at the list of choices and think ""I don't want to do any of these things. There's a reasonable choice missing."" (A full game usually involves five self-contained loops. On plays 2-5 the game will block off routes you have taken in the previous loops. Fear not, once you get the credit screen all choices will again be available. Or you can just start a new game.) The voice acting is both spot on and a critical component of conveying the emotions and trustworthiness of the characters. This game is more than simply a story. It's an examination of psychology and moral choices in a very real, visceral, and grounded manner...at least as grounded as a fantasy story can be.

183643333,1989270,"For the longest time i didn't really have a way to contribute to the ""what game will you pick if you could wipe your memory off of it and have a fresh start again"" topics. Now, i think i do. This one. I'll be honest, i envy you, the person reading this, if you never played or saw this game yet. For all 30 hours up until now, i was hooked on trying every option, every route. To listen, to laugh, to anguish, to get a gut wrenched sideways. But slowly i'm reaching the end. Sure i could just reset my progress and go at it again, but it won't change that i know the outcomes. Board reset will not change anything. Maybe i'll return later, when i forget. When the time to meet Princess is again. Join me. The Princess is worth it. Her voices, our voices. Our actions, her reactions, our reactions, her actions. Slaying or not. Now pushing off the melancholy a little bit, objectively speaking this game is awesome, even for a person like me that doesn't have much interest in visual novels. Great voice acting, incredibly variety of choices ranging from sickly sweet down to morbidly cruel and everything in between, with outcomes from satisfying to ones you would prefer to alt+f4 then to experience them. You will feel happy, sad, distraught, in awe, in pain. And by the time it is done - you will long for the spark that you experienced, but the only way for you to do so is to forget. And Princess will still be here, when the time comes to meet again. Definitely worth it. And remember, most of all, regardless of what you choose or not.

I especially love how reactive the world is to your actions and the short term and long term consequences and dangers you'll face based on your actions. The monster is absolutely terrifying in appearance with this fear only being amplified as it destroys everything in its path in an attempt to hunt you down. Leaving the relative ""safety"" of your hiding place and observing the wreckage left in the wake of the monsters endeavours to find you is almost as terrifying as if it were to actually succeed in its efforts. Having to navigate slowly through areas with debris, or move objects out of the way to proceed forward adds to this building tension whenever the monster is not in play and hiding in the walls as during these periods of downtime, said monster is actively listening for you, waiting in anticipation. The monsters behaviour, the reactive world and the large collection of game modifiers and random generation keeps the game fresh and keeps it scary where other horror titles would begin to falter. Easily a 10/10 game for me that I'll continue to play even after completing multiple playthroughs and 100%ing the game.

There are only a few games I would not recommend you play with a headset on if you have a heart condition, and this is one of them. The sound design is stellar and this game will make sure to take every opportunity to startle you like a mofo and leave you white knuckled as you creep along in the dark hearing things clawing behind the was or whispering in your ears. No game is perfect, and this one has some little bugs - but Amnesia: The Bunker proves you really don't need fancy graphics, giant AAA teams, or even a big budget to design what is probably the best horror title on steam in a long time. It is also not a very demanding title and can be had very cheap many times thru-out the year - especially during sales where it gets as low as $12.49.

175492112,1944430,"Amnesia: The Bunker is a 2023 survival horror game by Frictional Games. It's World War I, and you're a French soldier stuck in a ruined underground bunker together with something hostile. Like most games by this developer, this is a first-person horror game with a lot of physics interactions. Many of the game world's items can be picked up, thrown or broken. Doors and cabinets, likewise, feel like they have actual weight and have to be pulled open. It's something that makes the game world feel notably interactive and gives the gameplay some unique flavor. Another trademark of Frictional Games is that their games are very good at creating a tense atmosphere where you often feel powerless. Many of their past games don't have combat at all, and although Amnesia: The Bunker has guns and grenades, they can't be relied on forever. The sound design is also extremely immersive - these games are basically worth playing for the sound and music alone. The dark ambient background music helps you sink deep into a suffocating mood of paranoia and darkness. The main thing that sets Amnesia: The Bunker apart from previous Frictional Games' titles is that it has a stronger focus on gameplay and replayability than lore. It could be likened to a horror sandbox with a semi-open environment and many elements which are randomized on each playthrough. Some key items are always found in the same locations, giving a consistent logic to the overall level progression and allowing the player to plan ahead. But other than that - items and codes are new on each playthrough, and the monster in particular can be highly unpredictable. Like in Alien: Isolation, this game has an unique ""stalker"" enemy that is hellbent on staying on your tail and showing up at various inopportune times. This monster moves behind walls and is attracted by noise yet avoids light. It's possible to fuel the bunker's old generator to make areas lit for a while, but this simply adds another layer of tension to the gameplay. Do you want to use a limited fuel resource to give yourself temporary (and relative) safety, or brave the darkness alone? The level design is definitely one of the highlights of the game. It's intuitive yet also tells a story. There's a reason for why everything is as messed up as it is, and you'll slowly discover it during the game through short cutscenes and logs. Each sub-area feels unique and has its own feel to it, which helps the game stay interesting all the way through as you progress through it. The game isn't very long, but as mentioned, it's geared for replayability. My first playthrough took about 7 hours on Normal. I then did a second playthrough on Hard, which lasted 2.5 hours. Understanding the level layouts and having a grip on the game's mechanics definitely made a big difference for survivability. As you gain more information, you will be able to tackle harder and harder challenges... at least, if you're feeling up to it. I even watched a playthrough on ""max difficulty"", which is when you push the difficulty sliders all the way past the game's official toughest difficulty, limiting yourself to a very small inventory, no ability to save, minimal resources and ultra-aggressive stalker. The tactics on this mode are quite impressive, and I even got to wondering: would it be possible to do win streaks in Amnesia: The Bunker on higher difficulties, much like people do streaking in other challenging games with randomized elements like The Binding of Isaac or Slay the Spire? Based on everything I've learnt, I'm inclined to say that the game might be a bit too unpolished for that. Yes, although impressive in a lot of respects, it does have some bugs. For example, I got two crashes after putting the game window out of focus for some time during bathroom breaks. The physics can also do some wonky stuff sometimes, and considering this is a game where physics objects create sound which the stalker can use to find the player, well... you can see how that could lead to a disaster. I've seen some strange enemy-related bugs as well. So, although it's an interesting idea, I'm not sure you can actually beat the game consistently on the most extreme settings. I wouldn't mind to be proven wrong, though! Subjectively, I found Amnesia: The Dark Descent scarier, but Amnesia: The Bunker isn't close behind in this regard. It's a very intense horror title with fairly intricate gameplay mechanics. It's not without its frustrating moments, but understanding how it works can be quite rewarding too. It's definitely worth trying out if this kind of gameplay seems appealing and/or you liked Frictional Games' past titles.",2024-09-21 22:21:52,11.53,True,0,0,0,False,False,

The sound design is amazing, the gameplay loop is very fun, the story is dark and very interesting.. I can't think of any complaints for this game.

182387694,1944430,"Who would have thought Frictional would deliver a smaller scale, immersive sim twist on Alien: Isolation as the latest entry in their flagship, up-until-now-primarily-narrative-horror franchise? It’s not what I would have guessed, but given the somewhat lukewarm reception to the prior two entries I’m not surprised they chose to mix things up. And by all accounts it appears to have been a pretty good move for them. As far as immersive sim design philosophy goes (ie. multiple ways to approach situations, reactive gameplay elements, etc.) these can often be found in horror-adjacent games, but for various reasons pure horror tends more towards rigidity. The Bunker on the other hand largely ignores those constraints, trading curated scares for an omnipresent invincible creature that prowls the tunnels as it waits for a reason to emerge. You have some options to keep it at bay, but they are limited; your best bet is to stay quiet, but of course that isn’t always viable. Needless to say, it can get tense. Like, REALLY tense. This is amplified by the fact that you have a limited supply of fuel to keep the bunker’s meager lighting active (and thus deter the creature), so if you want some semblance of safety you’ll need to continually push further outwards in search of supplies and the items you need to escape. Naturally you also have limited inventory space, so you’ll need to weigh your options carefully before each expedition. When you don’t have the benefit of the lights you’ll need to rely on your mechanical flashlight for guidance, which requires periodic cranking to recharge - and yes, this will alert your monster pal if he’s nearby. In that sense, the core of the gameplay hasn’t actually changed that much from previous entries; stealth and flight-over-fight are still major design pillars. You just have a lot more tools at your disposal for progressing this time around and the levels are designed with a more sandbox approach in mind. In regards to the level design, I was admittedly a bit skeptical of how interesting a game set entirely in a bunker could look after seeing the first announcement. This was not an issue though, as while it may not have the most striking art direction, everything felt appropriate for the setting and the game is short enough that the environments don’t overstay their welcome. This was aided by the great sound design as well, particularly for the creature and the sounds of war on the surface. Given Alien: Isolation is one of my favourite horror games, I wasn’t surprised that I really enjoyed The Bunker. Besides the gameplay advances it still has a lot of the classic Amnesia feel via the scattered notes and overall plotline, as well as some clever setpiece scares that don’t involve your ill-tempered bunker-mate. Also, for as much as I liked Isolation, this game benefits from being a much more compact experience. It even leans into this by providing various customization options and randomized elements that make the prospect of a second playthrough a lot less daunting than another twenty hours of hide and seek with a xenomorph. I’ll be interested to see where Frictional takes the series next. I could certainly go for another title in this vein, but I suspect they might have other plans. Whatever the case, I’ll probably be there for it - after finally getting around to playing the second and third entries for myself, hopefully.",2024-12-10 03:41:15,6.03,True,1,0,0.52,False,False,

173897920,1944430,"This is an amazing game! One of my Top 3 now I was worried it will not hook me as other games, but it overcame my expectations. The setting is well thought out and immersive, mechanics of going through the bunker are very ominous and makes you scared on every corner. That is if you play on settings the game recommends you. I saw many people playing on high gamma due to low vision, which made me wonder why would people completely bypass the whole premise of the game. In low gamma (the recommended one) you barely see into the darkness and without a light you are basically running around as chicken. There is the Amnesia blue filter tho so you still get some vision. At the end of the game i put the gamma a bit up so i dont need to put it on my pc and it felt like cheating. From barely seeing into the end of the hall i was able to see the bottle that would be in darkness perfectly. So i lowered it again to continue my immersion. The game's motto about trying and it may work is true. Like you can be the maniac and throw grenades like an idiot and it work eventually. I heard people complaining about the flashlight you get that its garbage and how its useless. It is sometimes, but it is a point of game - game of sounds and distractions. It's literally Cat & mouse situation in the bunker. You must be careful what you are doing. But for me it was never massive hassle. Itps not like everytime you crank it the mosnter appears near you, so don't worry. Better than the lighter, to be honest. I want to adress the setting as well, because the writers really nailed it. It really hit like ""we are in WW1 frontlines and no, it was not nice times"". The sadness, anguish, depression, insanity. All that in every note i found was just like a french chef's kiss. Henri is really well written protagonist, who is not out of place, who did mistakes previously and he strongly regrets them. In short - a great representation of ww1 soldier. There are some nitpicks i have with the game (SPOILERS): [spoiler] in Roman tunnels when i got into the area, i was a bit scared about the Touissant guy and how it will go. I was prepared for everything. The problem was just one - One bullet. That's all you need against him. Into the head. I will go to Shellshock mode to see if he needs even more but it ruined it a bit, ngl. If he would just hum his rhymes and then still shoot his shotgun normally it would be perfect. Cause he feels he is drunk, rather than insane. But yea, if the man point was making him human, then it was done right. It just bothers me cause the whole area looks like its prepared for massive sneak section when i needed just one bullet. But i think it may be for the Shellshock playthrough so i will see.[/spoiler] [spoiler] The Monster sometimes felt... dumb. Idk if its programmed like that but the Stalker likes to hit lot of random stuff around him. Even explosive barrels... on his own. So it was sometimes easy him doing something dumb like that and just running back home. But hey, i played on normal difficulty so it may i guess depend on difficulty itself [/spoiler] [spoiler]The ending was a bit confusing of what I am suppose to do, but it didnt took a long time for me to understand it [/spoiler] Overall, the game is awesome and a masterpiece of horror. I would be so happy if Amnesia would go by this direction quite more - the surviving horror with guns and managing resources. I will try in the future the Shellshock mode and potentially write the additional information for those, who may try the mode for themselves.

Now, I can safely say I'm flat out disappointed. I hate this game. I hate that I hate it because I want to like it so badly, but it's just not a good game. This game is full of fantastic ideas that were HORRIBLY implemented. They just threw as many mechanics in as possible, and made the game feel messy, overly and unnecessarily complicated, and unrefined. While it's interesting that they went back to primarily using notes for storytelling, and I usually love that, they managed to make the game boring. The game feels like they don't understand the difference between fear and stress. The game is not scary at all. It's just stressful. The primary enemy isn't scary after the first couple times he shows up, and just becomes another tedious mechanic. The rats are just annoying, and I've died to them chasing me more than I ever died to the main enemy. Part of why I took a year long break was frustration with the excessive number of mechanics and the damn rats. I'm glad they added an option to make them not hurt you, as it dramatically improves the gameplay. The generator runs out of fuel rapidly, even with all the lights turned off, to the point that it's not even worth using because it'll run out before you ever get where you're going. I played most of the game without the generator because it runs out so fast, and it's so tedious to try to deal with. The inventory system is a stingier version of RE. This game also has mechanical issues. Items getting stuck, your character going flying up and down while hiding between boxes, and constant framerate drops out of nowhere, and in the middle of hallways that are being used as loading areas instead of a loading screen, which is another great idea that was horribly executed.",2024-08-10 22:40:07,10.25,False,8,0,0.49,False,False,

This is without hyperbole one of the greatest horror games ever made. I have never been so scared of a game in my life, and yet the Immersive Sim element is done in such masterful fashion I couldn't stop playing. I wanted to stop but couldn't. Immersive Sim fans have been treated pretty well recently. Ctrl Alt Ego is an absolute masterpiece, as is Cruelty Squad. There are a number of indie ImSims coming up that look very promising as well. But Amnesia The Bunker took emerging gameplay elements and fused it perfectly with the survival horror genre. The product is a short but extremely sweet and absolutely relentless assault on your primitive prey instincts. Adding to the terror of my own personal experience with this game was the fact that since I hadn't been paying a whole lot of attention, I thought The Bunker was just a World War I game. Like a military survival sim. I was well aware of The Dark Descent but for whatever reason I was under the impression that this was going to be a gritty, realistic reenactment of trench warfare. The hilarity is that for the first five or ten minutes it certainly feels that way. I was almost underwhelmed by the opening. The graphics are by no means eye-popping. Sound and music were top notch though. However after my character sustained damage from a battle against Germany invading France, it soon becomes clear that something is terribly, terribly wrong. You wake up in a germaphobe's nightmare. Everything is dirty. Lights are flickering. You hear the occasional bomb muffled heavily by the armored underground fortress in which you now step. And one thing that dawned on me very quickly was this thought of ""Huh. Everything's quiet, and I'm making a lot of noise. I mean my steps are really loud."" After picking up a few notes and a disturbing photo as is standard fare in Frictional games, you find a single living person near the ruined, abandoned pantry. He tells you that the bunker has been abandoned-- its exit sealed by explosions. He gives you a couple general clues on where you can find the missing components to reopen the exit. He also asks you to kill him. But as you go to the pantry to pick up rounds to grant his grim ask, he disappears screaming. One of the things that amazes me about this game is the pacing. Some of you know I'm an Alien fan, partly because the first half of the movie is dedicated entirely to hard and soft world building. You're treated to something similar here because you're stumbling around in the darkness, and nothing is really happening. As you get acquainted with the layout you start noticing things like fuel canisters you can pick up, clothing to combine together to make bandages (these are things revealed to you in the trench opening), and rats scurrying about, into their little holes. You also start noticing other holes. Big holes. Holes that were not made by rats. And you start hearing things. In the walls. Something big. Not a rat. And yet still nothing happens. You arrive at administration office which will become your base of operations. There are two doors here, and I did notice-- big steel doors with locks. Hmm. The map is presented on the wall here in this office, and only here. You can't take it with you. Did you wander into the offices and get lost? Tough shit. Find your way back and look at the goddamn map in the office. And let me just say one of the most brilliant things about this game is how it deals with maps. I'm sick of minimaps. I believe a lot of times minimaps are used in lieu of good level design. If you throw a minimap into your game you don't have to have smart, cohesive level design. Because you have a minimap. I recently finished Dragon Age II and before it, Dragon Age Origins and as much as I love DAO, I found myself in both games focusing on the minimap instead of what was actually on the screen. In DA2 especially, some pretty bland level design uses this as a crutch and I just continually fell into this habit of watching the arrow go through lines in the corner of the screen. It was one of my criticisms of Skyward Sword which admittedly used ""dowsing"" instead which is creative, but still a crutch. One thing I will add is that as you progress into the other areas you will find appendices that will update your main map at base. But there is no minimap to be found in Amnesia: The Bunker. There is, however a handy dandy flashlight from the Civil War era, which winds up. You crank this thing a few times and it gives you about 15-20 seconds of light, and again I noticed--- ""This thing makes a lot of noise."" Not a chance THIS ever becomes an issue. Resident Evil-esque puzzles await you. A wheel to open a quarantine lock, a wrench to loosen bolts on vent covers that you can't take off otherwise, and the survival horror quintessentials, bolt cutters and lighter. The combining of cloth isn't just for bandages- you make torches, Molotov cocktails and probably other things I wasn't creative enough to figure out. There's a centralized locker room with essential items locked, and each one has a padlock whose combinations can only be found on dogtags you'll find throughout the bunker. Also every playthrough gives randomized combinations so on subsequent runs you won't be able to just beeline to the locker room and grab your shotgun, gas mask and other quest items. Nope, you'll have to go into the darkness and grab these tags to get the goods. Numerous light switches are found and serve as progression points for you. Sometimes you'll have to get a sequence of them, a chain if you will, in order for them all to function and give you visibility on precious resources and story notes. The immersive sim elements are perfectly folded into this masterpiece. You will often find that there are numerous ways to get where you need to go. This goes hand in hand with the fact that most items are randomized as well. The difference between wood and steel plays a crucial element here. There will be times when you won't be able to open a door without triggering a trap, or open it at all, unless you find a brick somewhere and bash the wooden frame out or use a grenade. It goes without saying that these methods also create a lot of noise. Keys exist, but you'll find that box stacking and the like are just as pertinent. Another really cool thing about this game is the weapons system. Ammo is scarce. I mean really scarce. I found twelve rounds for the revolver my first playthrough. And I only found five shotgun shells and never found the shotgun on the first run. These weapons are an absolute last resort. This is what you use when you have literally no other option. And to emphasize how important they are and yet how seldom they should be used, the loading mechanic is such that you hold down the R button to open the cylinder, and then you load each round individually one by one. Not that you'll have many fucking rounds anyway. I never had a full six in the chamber. If you have four, you're lucky. The shotgun is the same-- each shell is loaded individually. So even if you had a bunch of rounds to use, loading your gun is a dynamic in which you will not be able to reload in the heat of the moment. And did I mention that the generator located in the admin office, runs on gasoline, and will deplete? One of the most useful tools in the game is a timer that reads how long you have given how much fuel you've put in. When it runs out, it doesn't matter where you are--- all the lights everywhere go out, and you're plunged into darkness. And in the darkness, he comes out to hunt for you. I ran out of space.

Got into it around Christmas and simply put it is a great game but needs some potential to be the solid sequel to the original game! A fair comparison to me at the moment the game feels like EAs Battlefront 2 when it came out it had good mechanics and gameplay but was lacking the finesse. Then all the updates came around and the game felt perfect and had a huge boost over the covid years until no more support. I hope the devs put loads of support and updates which I see they plan to do with their roadmaps so im excited to see where this goes. Things I would say that would be the cherry on top for me is more Chaos skins as at the moment its one legion per class essentially with slight customisation. Perhaps a chaos own coop mode? (like old SM game) and an exterminatus wave based mode which I think I heard is in the works and if so very cool just like the orks of yore.

This game offers you a really great story mode alongside amazing gameplay, the swarm mechanic and the utter chaos of things happening around you make you really feel you are in a battlefield risking ur life for the one true GOD EMPEROR. The swarm mechanic of the tyranids is absolutely amazing, the heretics also good enemies but feel a little bit more shallow compared to the tyranids. Plenty of weapons which are all fun. One of the main things here are Amazing are the stunning graphics and visuals that are really well optimized, I can play the game with no screen tears nor fps drops which has been a common issue with most newer releases with various developers. The executions are absolutely stunning and simply put awesome with a huge variety of them depending on the weapon you have and the enemy you are facing. The campaign gives a fair challenge while not being too hard (played veteran mode) and there are no bugs that I've come across.

184337677,2183900,"Space Marine 2 feels like a complete game with full co-op support both campaign and PvE operations. I haven’t run into many bugs—other than the Tyranids. The campaign is short, took me about 8 hours to finish on my first run with two friends, but it was a blast. The operations add some good replay value, and the classes are well-balanced. Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they work really well together. Not played the PvP mode so I can't really say much about that. I played Assault, while my friends went with Tactical and Heavy, and the combo worked perfectly. The Tactical abilities paired with the Assault’s jetpack and ground slam with the Thunder Hammer made quick work of bosses and elites. Meanwhile, the Heavy wiped out the smaller enemies and kept us covered with fire support. The teamwork feels smooth and satisfying. I’m really looking forward to the new Horde mode and the class prestige system. Lately, I haven’t been hyped for a lot of games because so many release unfinished or broken, but Space Marine 2 has been a nice change. It’s refreshing to play something that actually delivers. Plus, it doesn’t shove DLC and season passes in your face every two minutes. Sure, they show you the extras, but you don’t feel pressured to buy them. The base game has plenty of content on its own, and it looks like new operations and Horde mode will be part of a free update, which is awesome.

184149802,2183900,"To quote my favourite meme of the early 2010's ""DISAPPOINTED!"" All of my play time has been in the co-op ""operations"" mode, getting hard carried by a friend on console who pre-ordered, and is long since done with everything in the game. So take my opinions of the gameplay with a grain of salt. With that caveat out of the way, lets get started! DLSS is a NECESSITY! Even when set to balanced I still drop below 80 FPS, meanwhile everything has that pre-teen puberty peach fuzz look to it. There's a film of fuzz like blur over everything that worsens with quick movements, which this game requires a lot of. My rig consists of a 4070 Ti/i7 13700k/32g DDR5 RAM etc. I play at 1440p and at default settings I was getting around 70 FPS while out of combat and not moving, I ended up Googling ""best settings"" options and even when following the many suggestions I found, I still struggle to maintain and keep above 100 FPS, as previously mentioned often dropping below 80. I play on KBM, and whoever decided what the default keybinds should be clearly has never played a game on KBM in their lives. Middle mouse to aim? C to block/parry? RMB and LMB being melee or shoot (blindfire) is also a strange decision that took me a solid couple hours to drill into my brain. Remember how I said I was playing co-op and crossplay? Yeah, about that. Mans is too old and technologically illiterate to figure out how to join a party, so I'm forced to join him - things are fine on his end, he's got a crisp 30 ping while mine skyrockets well over 100. Not only are things fuzzy and blurry, but they're also in stop motion. I feel like I'm behind the scenes of a claymation movie, striking a pose and snapping a still image. There is no fluidity to anything, everything feels like you're fighting delay, parries don't work, dodging (if you can call it that, even the infamous Dark Souls ""fat roll"" is more of a dodge than in this game) rarely works. I had decently high hopes. I have 0 knowledge of WH40k lore, but I've always been a fan of their design and the creatures etc in the WH universe(s). I've played practically every WH game (minus the RTS) from the 40k ARPG and Boltgun, to both Vermintide and Darktide - heck even Necromunda and Chaosbane! Gross. All this to say this is yet another game in the 2024 catalogue of unoptimized, uninspired and ultimately disappointing games of AAA games of today. I'm sure there is something to be enjoyed if you're able to look past these problems, or if you have a deep understanding and appreciation for WH40k. But for the average consumer like myself? I'm not sure I could recommend it. TLDR: Poorly unoptimized mess, more ping than a game of ping pong, and grossly anti gamer default keybinds on KBM. Likely better if you have a $40k PC and a deep understanding or appreciation for WH40k lore stuffs.

Like harder levels of ""Enter the gungeon"" for example. In this game you have nothing to blame but yourself when you're hit. And i mean it! I am not a very good gamer and I managed on some levels to get through without getting hit. Because when you observe the patterns and know what#s coming you can position yourself.

Even if I don't choose to keep playing it, I won't refund because I like to support Indie games. People say it is an immersive exploration game, but I just never found anything interesting while doing so. I feel like a game needs to hook you... just like a good book, or a good blog, or an article, or even a movie to some degree... you have to build interest. You have to hook the reader/player and make them want to learn more. This game gives you basically nothing. It promises story-telling glory, but you have to kind of just go on faith. I don't really like that, because I have no idea how much of my life I'm going to have to sink in order to find a nugget of this story, and even then I have no idea if I will actually like it. It doesn't help that I don't like the character design... I find them a bit awkward and strange, and not in a good way. But that is very personal, I'm sure people love them. The physics are fun but that lasted about... 5 to 10 mins. Then I found myself kind of just sitting back, one hand on the controller and daydreaming about other games while doing random circles in orbit around a rock. Honestly the whole thing became one big snooze fest. I even found some type of gravity well thing, in some kind of alien ruin? It had me walk down to the end and... die, I guess? I dunno. But even that was just not interesting. It didn't say anything, it was just there and without any context. There's no fun in that, it's like turning to a random page in a random book and reading a paragraph. By itself it has no value, especially when it neither uncovers any secrets nor provides any context whatsoever. I'm glad for people that loved this game, but I don't.

183181926,753640,"December 15th - [B]Outer Wilds[/B] - 27h 24m - (Main+) 8/10 - Started December 5th - 10 Days Taken - Beat the main game and the DLC. Got 5/31 achievements. Here's my review: [b]Pros:[/b] Outer Wilds is a non-linear adventure game that encourages exploration. This could easily have resulted in a frustrating experience where players get stuck and don't know what to do next but it manages to avoid these traps by giving you leads on where to go next. A lot of the areas you explore will at some point, lead to some other area you need to learn more. This provides a logical next step for the player to follow. This worked so well that it was easy to [spoiler]do another loop[/spoiler] to explore the next area hinted at or apply the new knowledge I had learned. It made me play longer sessions than I originally planned because I kept saying ""Just one more [spoiler]loop[/spoiler]"". This system of leads, clues and knowledge is greatly benefited by the ship log, which helps organize and track all the information you have gathered so far. It removes a lot of the mental load off the player by not forcing them to remember all the information they've gathered throughout the entire game. It stores almost all the crucial information, such as the connections between various locations, even showing ones to locations you haven't visited yet, which can help prompt your next move. A great quality of life feature is that it tells you whether you gathered all the information within a specific area, which reduces player doubt and helps them be more focused in their exploration. In essence, the ship log removes the frustration of a non-linear mystery game without detracting from the player's feeling that they are solving the puzzles themselves and from receiving the eureka moments when things finally click together. Intertwining the story and the mysteries was a great choice. The more you explore and learn the more you piece together about the story. The story is quite a sad and tragic one. The [spoiler]Nomai were stranded in an unfamiliar star system and yet managed to persevere and almost reach the eye themselves. But they were wiped out by the ghost matter from the interloper at the last step. Then you step in, salvage it and reforge the galaxy anew. The game's time loop mechanic being part of the story all along was a shocking reveal[/spoiler] that meshes with the story perfectly. Echoes of the Eye complements the story further by adding a further layer of tragedy and sadness to it. The [spoiler]strangers got curious about the eye and sacrificed their entire planet to reach it. Once they did, they learned of its horrors, but by then it was too late. To retain their old way of life, they recreated their old planet virtually so they could still live out their lives on it. They even tried to stop the eye, so no other species could be lured to their doom like they were, but one rogue stranger released the eye's block for long enough for the Nomai to get attracted to the eye as well. However, in a twisted way, that act indirectly allows you the player to save the stranger's species by including them in the recreation of the universe.[/spoiler] Outer Wild's music is also important because while most of the time it is silent when it isn't, it plays well into the narrative and gameplay. It [spoiler]signifies when you're close to the end of a loop and that same music is played when you remove the warp core from the center of the Ashen twin to highlight the significance of what you're doing. I especially enjoyed the climactic music that played while in the Vessel after supplying it with the warp core. The best musical aspect of the game, however, has to be the main theme. You hear it every time you boot up the game on the main menu, but it's more than just that because every member of the Hearthian crew also plays one instrument of the song. This means you hear the song much more than you may think and results in the final scene hitting that much harder. You bring all the instruments together and finally hear the full complete version of the song during gameplay. [/spoiler] [B]Neutral:[/B] One nice QOL feature would've been the ability to [spoiler]restart at a loop[/spoiler] at any time without having to exit the game to the main menu and then resume the game because all it does is waste time. [b]Cons:[/b] There's only one part of the game that genuinely frustrated me and resulted in me having to use a guide to progress. That part was [spoiler]how to reach the first tablet in the Shrouded Woodlands.[/spoiler] I was conditioned to think that the solution to [spoiler]reach each tablet was limited to each area because that was the case with the second and third tablets, which I did before the first one.[/spoiler] I could've maybe figured this out by myself if I had a cool head and wasn't already frustrated to hell and back. What frustrated me you say? [spoiler]The Stranger's. To reach the previous two solutions you had to kite and lure the Strangers away from where they were standing so you could get past them.[/spoiler] This is a very action-heavy mechanic in a puzzle game and it goes against a principle that the base game strives for. This principle is that after you figure out the solution to a puzzle and have the eureka moment, actually executing it and getting your reward shouldn't be too difficult and take a long time. The longer it takes to reach the reward, the more the positive feeling of solving the puzzle diminishes. By adding the more action-based [spoiler]Strangers[/spoiler], knowing the solution wasn't enough and you had to [spoiler]kite and lure the Strangers multiple times in the dark.[/spoiler] Safe to say that this got quite frustrating after enough failed attempts. The only [spoiler]enemy[/spoiler] in the base game, [spoiler]the anglerfish had a clear weakness you could exploit[/spoiler] and after you figured it out, you didn't have to worry [spoiler]about them[/spoiler] anymore. The same can't be said for [spoiler]the Strangers.[/spoiler] They put a massive blemish on an otherwise wonderful DLC that explores a bunch of interesting and unique puzzle ideas.",2024-12-20 10:27:55,27.37,True,0,0,0,False,False,

At the risk of sounding like a gatekeeper... I think it takes a certain kind of person to truly appreciate what Outer Wilds is. If you enjoy piecing together a story yourself, if you like investigating and finding things out on your own, if you prefer not to look things up and form your own unique perspective on the stories you experience; then you will absolutely love this game and it will stick with you forever. To another kind of person, they get told this is the greatest game ever made, to go into the game as blind as possible and avoid any spoilers at all costs. They might play the game for an hour or two, and realize it's essentially a space exploration game with puzzle elements, and ultimately feel let down because their expectations were set so high. If you don't care as much about discovering a story on your own, if you just want to get to the core of the secret that this game so eloquently hides, then you might benefit more from simply watching a video about the game rather than playing it yourself. Which pains me to say, since I personally love this game and think it is best experienced by playing it through oneself. A good parallel to gauge your interest is how you approach the story of Elden Ring or other Soulsborne games. Do you like how those games present their stories in silence? Do you enjoy reading item descriptions, analyzing dialogue and the characters who give them, observing subtle details about your environment, and inferring meaning through all those things put together? Or do you prefer to just rush through bosses, accrue power, beat the game as fast as possible, and save the storytelling for various YouTubers to present it to you in a more compelling way? In conclusion, if you're still curious: Buy. This. Game. You won't regret it. The music, the atmosphere, the breadcrumb trails that lead you to revelation after revelation; it's all executed beautifully, and I think in a way it brought me closer to the universe, and emboldened my curiosity in general.

The scale of the game is incredible, I feel like every play through I find new things, and the multitude of endings is pretty crazy. The characters in the game are really well written with great personalities and thats another testament to just how good the voice acting is.

The combat plays out fine and the ""homebrew"" Larian put into the game is a welcome addition. The homebrew, and all the Larian-isms that come with the dev's title. Play Divinity: Original Sin 2, they have more freedom with that title than they did here, but this isn't a review about DOS2. I recommend this game if you have 300 hours to pour into an unknown title that is obviously a labor of love - despite it becoming an annoying, buggy mess as soon as you enter the third act. As long as you enjoy having to make tough choices and living with an unsatisfactory ending, where you have to imagine in your *headcanon* things actually went right. Its multiplayer is also a lot like DOS2. I played with my partners for a while and we disagreed on some moral decisions enough we decided to stop playing.

I can see people ranking this a 10/10, but for me there's just a few grips: Enemy animations feel really slow, and having the ability to skip the party member animations but not the enemies feels like a waste. Especially when enemies can get upwards of 8 turns, then you're kinda just sitting there twiddling your thumbs hoping it ends soon. Going from the 4th party member to the 5th feels like it takes a lot longer than going from the 5th to the 6th. Now maybe that's just me because it took a full extra real life day to get them, but idk. Also wish you could trade money for MAG, seeing as I had a surplus amount of money leftover at the end of the game but barely enough MAG to get the final form for each companion. Now the good stuff: I really loved how [spoiler] there is a character for each race, just wished that there was a permanent Rhoag member along with us. Rest in peace goat Grius [/spoiler] In my opinion the Bond system is a lot better than the previous iterations. Letting us fully see what rank we are, instantly ranking up to the next one without needing spend extra time with them, and getting some extra MAG to help beef up our companions. Unfortunate that there's no romance system, but that's alright. Not every game needs a romance aspect to the relationship system, I personally prefer not having one for this game. Every since Archetype felt really fun to play, from getting the Gunner at first to completely decimate foes, to getting the GOAT Faker letting any ally add turns. And my goodness the reset battle feature *chef's kiss* letting the player not reset the whole game just to redo a single battle, so nice. Using this along with Faker's Roguery at the start of battle so that I can just start with 2-4 extra turns. It feels like they took notes on all the good aspects of previous main parties, and incorporated them into these one's. Loved every single party member.

183061564,2679460,"Short version: good but not great writing, but the gameplay is great -- especially if you enjoy job systems. As far as the writing is concerned, the people making this game had a point they wanted to make, and everything they wrote focused on it. It was well done, and as grumpy / picky as I am about writing, I still felt it was overall good. They had a goal in mind, and they achieved it. The writing isn't as good as Baldur's Gate 3 -- which isn't saying much since few games hit that level -- but the background NPCs get updated dialogue throughout the game. It reminded me of a Trails game, although it's not as tight / in depth. Anyway, if I play a RPG like this and only one of the party members irritates me, that's a win. The gameplay is dynamite. You level your characters as well as their jobs, so there's a lot of number go up to give you happy brain itches. The major fights in the game make you think, but they also aren't unforgiving slogs where you have to min-max every little thing. I play games to be just challenged enough to enjoy winning, and this game landed right in that groove. There are optional bosses at the end of the game that require more finesse (especially the final one), but for the base stuff it's not difficult to cruise through. I also enjoy the rhythm of the game. You have a deadline, load up on side quests, then cruise around the map knocking stuff off / building character relationships / training up your characters. The fact you get a home base is a plus, I always love having a base in a game. Sadly, there's no upgrading for this one, but I still like that sense of home versus being stuck in an endless parade of campsites for an entire RPG. If you do a lot of the side content, then you can also skip a decent number of turn-based battles in the main quest dungeon which really improves the flow.

184407714,2679460,"(Very mild spoilers) I was having an absolutely fantastic time with this game until the final month. It's here where the pacing of the game nosedives and you are forced to grind for hours to keep up with newer enemies. The amount of MAG the game gives you becomes a pittance compared to how much it costs to unlock classes and moves, which I found to be detrimental to my ability to edit my characters and make builds for specific encounters. And the game is all the worse for this because the entire time you're grinding or bashing your head against annoying bosses and trying to make new builds to counter them, you're not experiencing the excellent story, which I just wanted so badly to see the end of. Obviously, many people seem to have no issue with this section given all the GOTY nominations and awards, but for those of us that have been put off by other RPG's because of the need to grind, the final month of Metaphor feels like a trap set to either force you to spend time doing something you hate or to get you to give up and set the game to easy mode or story mode.",2025-01-01 08:07:48,79.38,False,1,0,0,False,False,

184383360,2679460,"Metaphor is a game I really enjoyed and definitely deserved its run for GOTY as a nominee, and as I am quickly approaching the end of my NG+ playthrough for the 100% achievements I can strongly recommend buying this as this whole game from start to finish was fantastic and definitely worth picking up if you can afford to. That being said I do have a minor issue that I want to raise, I love my Steam Deck and especially playing games like Persona on it as it allows me to jump between my desk and my couch or wherever, and whilst I think Metaphor is great on PC I am a little disappointed with its performance on Steam Deck. After Persona 3 Reload which ran fantastically and felt right at home it was a real shame to see the lack of care put into Metaphor's compatibility with the device. And yes it is just lack of care as the game arguably looks worse than some other Atlus games (like the aforementioned Persona 3 Reload) and yet runs noticeably worse than it. It absolutely does run and is enjoyable however towns absolutely chug (sometimes sub 20-30fps) and there are a multitude of tiny hard to read text boxes and alongside the forced letter-boxing for 16:9 is just not necessary, who knows maybe a future update will rectify all of this as it is simply a case of optimising for the device but as for now if you have the option to play on a PC rather than Steam Deck, I would recommend you play it there. Overall Metaphor is a solid game from a quality game developer. Feels and plays very similarly to both Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, a really good balance of mechanics and freedom.

183070300,2679460,"There's a certain prescience about Metaphor: Refantazio. After November's utter fustercluck of a political landscape, I honestly think Metaphor's themes and ideas took on a new form that united a lot of people. The tough outlook of the world has and will be used as an excuse to delve ourselves into Fantasy and seclude ourselves from that horror. Metaphor challenges that notion, suggesting and promoting the struggles of fantasy that often go ignored. The racism, classism, beliefs, abuse of institutions such as monarchy, religion and military. Now these themes aren't things that are ignored in fiction, many works of fiction tackle them as key centrepoints of their narrative, but seldom as a theme or point of discussion, rather as decoration for the plot. Metaphor addresses these struggles and asks an honest question. ""Can fantasy be used as a means to craft an ideal future?"" The book in Metaphor, a novel that depicts a utopia where everyone forges their own destiny and creates a future everyone can believe in, is addressing the utopias we create in our world. Do we write and read worlds of idealism without these struggles as a means to escape our world or as an outlet to portray our ideal futures? We criticise media that portrays worlds as realistic or overlooking cruelties that society create, something that the cast of Metaphor do regularly as a means to question aspects and idealism in the real world, but is that not promoting discussion to create a more ideal future? I believe thinking about how the world can improve and how we make better futures is a pivotal aspect in art that everyone strives to interpret, and those thoughts can shape the views of youth and idealists whom seek to change the world. What society needs to do is put their words forward and help make the world better, bit by bit, in the hopes we can create that better future. One of Hope instead of one of desperation. Anyway, Metaphor is a very great game. I love the world in this game so much, being so fleshed out and diverse with strong characters and viewpoints that color it's landscape far deeper than many others I've seen in games. It's rare that everything has felt so cohesive in a story like this, and I think this is one of Hashino's best aspects of a writer. In fact, in my eyes, this is the best written Atlus title by a wide margin. I prefer the stories of Persona 3 and 5, but Metaphor's overall writing and perspectives are so grand in scale and rich in thought that I can't help but enjoy every second spent in this world, as cruel as it is. I don't disagree about the points about it's subtly, it's fairly blunt in it's approach. That said, I feel like this game, more than most, earns it's approach owing to the world as it is now. This message needs to be heard, loud and proud, and it's not as though the conversation is blunt at all, it's got a lot of strong perspectives and nuance to how these themes are portrayed and discussed in-narrative. The best compliments are reserved for the main cast though. While Strohl, Hulkenberg, Bastilio and Eupha are all great, my biggest compliments go to Heismay and especially Louis. If I've taken anything from this year, these two characters are proof that Atlus can write compelling as hell characters that reflect both the great and awful in the world, especially Louis who is undoubtedly my favorite villain of the year. The gameplay is pretty standard Atlus-flair, but considering it's building off years and years of Shin Megami Tensei's designs and ideas, it feels refined to the point of perfection. The game honestly feels harder than the majority of Atlus' previous titles, it honestly felt like I was playing Persona 3's cruel gameplay systems again. It's good stuff, and the archetypes and enemy design keeps the model distinct. I do wish the dungeons had a bit more variety in all, I only really felt as though the Cathedral and Louis' Runner had strong dungeons overall and the side dungeons were pretty bland, but that's honestly not a huge complaint. I feel as though it's hard to explain how special Metaphor is as a title. While it lacks some of the sheer political teeth of games like Disco Elysium, I feel as though the sheer cruelty and optimism of Metaphor Refantazio are better reflected and representative to the world as a collective. It's honestly such an amazing game to me. It's not quite up there as Persona 3 or 5, but, honestly, I'm more inclined to be happy with Metaphor owing to it's status as a new IP. With the bar set up with Metaphor, I am so goddamn excited for what comes next with this IP. 9/10. Feels like a goddamn antidote to the past few months of negativity.

184157307,2679460,"Project Re:Fantasy, now known as Metaphor Re:Fantazio, has been in the works for more than 7 years, and it shows. It always sounded interesting, especially with the many recommendations by Yoko Taro - the director of Nier. From the team that gifted us Persona 5, a game that I deeply loved although my first real entry point to the genre, I had expectations of nothing but excellence, and I'm really glad I was right. Extremely minor spoilers about the intro ahead. [h1]Not just Fantasy[/h1] The story of Metaphor Re:Fantazio is set in the fantasy world of Euchronia, a land that is deeply divided in racially-motivated political and religious conflict between the core 8 races that inhabit it. Its political and social topics are incredibly contemporary, to almost an uncanny level. This world spoke to me in ways Persona never has. Maybe it's because I'm more interested in fantasy than contemporary stories, or maybe because of the current climate in the world. As if releasing it before November was a way to strive and encourage change... We play the role of the Hero, who's part of a resistance, on a mission to infiltrate the army. The objective is to learn more from a contact they have in it, in regard to a curse that has been plaguing the Prince of the land for more than 10 years, leaving him in a comatose state. With us, the magical fairy Gallica serves as a guide in our adventure. The Hero always carries, and is very attached, to a novel the Prince used to read with him, where a utopia is described: a land where conflict doesn't exist, there is no racial discrimination and everyone lives in harmony. This land that eerily reminisces of our world is naught but fantasy for them, as this world is fantasy to us. The story is narrated to us at points by a narrator, almost as if you'd be listening to an audiobook, and it's a beautiful way to really make you [i]live[/i] the fantasy. There's no shortage of good writing and twists, personally keeping me hooked the whole time. The [b]art direction[/b] of the game is one of the best I've ever seen, no wonder it won a Game of the Year for it. Each new area is stunning, from the great city of Gran Trad to the shores of Brileheaven, the game is polygonally and artistically superior to all other games in the Persona series I've played. Worth mentioning is the [b]music[/b] in the game, which while featuring fewer tracks than usual, is an extreme banger and is the only thing making me happy about finishing the game: I get to listen to it on [b]repeat[/b]. [h1]The Archetype of Persona[/h1] Coming from the same developers, I had somewhat of an idea of what the game would look like, and, indeed: Metaphor Re:Fantazio does follow a lot of concepts that are part of the Persona series. Starting from the [b]quotidian nature of its story[/b], having the player follow the Hero not through a told X amount of months, but actually play and live them, day by day with rare time-skips. Each activity takes half of the day to complete, with dungeons taking the whole day when coming back. Nothing can be skipped. [b]Confidants[/b] are back, with many people along our journey becoming close friends of ours and asking us for help in their disadventures. Each new confidant unlocks new powers, called Archetypes, and leveling the confidant up gives said archetype family more options. These are especially improved in Metaphor Re:Fantazio, with none being a second thought or a rejection of writing. All companions were as good as some of the best in previous Persona games, and although there is not an option to romance any of them, part of me is happier. I'm sure the devs would have again limited who I could romance, so I'd rather leave it to interpretation, personally. [b]Archetypes[/b], similar to Personas or Stands from JoJo Bizzarre's Adventure, are back as the main magical power we use to cast many spells and abilities, but compared to the other games, the limitation of having only the Hero being able to use all of them, is no more. All characters can use all Archetypes, with no limits but their true final form. I preferred this approach over Personas. Leveling an Archetype unlocks some of its abilities to be purchased for an in-game currency to be equipped by other archetypes; i.e., I had my main Warrior stacked with healing abilities. Even at max confidant level, you can't completely erase the nature of an Archetype with inherited skills, because you'll always be limited to max 4. On the other hand, in Persona you do this by using Skill Cards you obtain as loot from enemies, without any limits to what you can overwrite. With most, if not all, abilities being a Skill Card, I rarely found myself choosing a Persona over another instead of just ""installing"" all the abilities I wanted on the Persona that looked the coolest. Additionally, although some fan-favorite designs are back, all enemies and Archetypes are brand-new designs, whereas Persona has the tendency to normally reuse all enemies and Personas from previous games while adding new ones. The [b]UI[/b] is again a masterwork, with incredible designs and animation for each menu, blending both 2D and 3D together. Perfectly fitting of the art style, and with an amazing sound design. A feature to kill lower-level enemies in ""[b]action mode[/b]"" of Persona 5 you'd get from a confidant at level 7 is expanded, making it now a base feature and expanding it with a dodge, movesets for each weapon family, etc. Therefore, over-leveling is a great choice if you prefer the action-oriented approach when exploring dungeons while keeping the turn-base for bosses. Worth mentioning: in turn-based having the hero die in the fight won’t force a reset anymore! [url=https://youtu.be/CM7o8NtRgRQ][h1]OH LORD! Again, a-f-gain. Nothing new, nothin' changed. Same old shi.[/h1][/url] Reader, I'm going to level with you. When I saw the first trailer of the Persona 3 Remake, I rejoiced they were using Unreal Engine, whereas normally I'm disappointed when devs do that - the industry needs diversity, over a messy unoptimized engine used by everyone 'cause easy. If it wasn't for the Fox Engine, MGS:V would have never run on PS3. When I saw the first trailer of Metaphor Re:Fantazio and noticed the familiar shimmering of the AA my reaction was the same as in the above title. Persona 5 has many positive sides: its engine is not one of them. At the demo's launch, the performances were a mess, and overall the engine just doesn't stand the test of time in both feature and fidelity. The worst offender is when traveling outside the city on a vehicle, with the areas around it being very scarce and low in density and detail. Metaphor Re:Fantazio, again has an atrocious AA, helped by the option to render at higher resolution internally. Thankfully they patched in FXAA a few days after lunch; better than SMAA. Textures are passable, but up close in some cutscenes, it really is a bit of an eyesore for a next-gen game only; some could have a higher quality. I'm not sure if now all features available from the mod Metaphor Fix are in the game, but I strongly suggest using it for both skipping the intro, disabling the continuous camera noise which adds to the bad AA, and especially the depth-of-field and lines when sprinting. [h1]𝔗𝔥𝔢 𝔈𝔫𝔡[/h1] Metaphor Re:Fantazio learns from the mistakes of Persona. It delivered a stunning package that spoke to my very core and kept me hooked the whole way through. Not a better package, but one that stands with the best we've got so far, adding itself to that upper echelon of JRPGs you suggest to the people you [i]really[/i] like, excited just at the idea you'll get to talk about it with one more person. From the demo in September, to the release in October, to my month-long pause and return in December: this game lived rent-free in my mind and it will continue doing so in my playlist. This story ended, but the fantasy? That lives on. [b]8.5/10[/b]",2024-12-29 21:49:26,82.4,True,20,1,0.7,False,False,
183859911,2679460,"What an incredible game, I haven't had so much fun playing a RPG in a looooooooong time. Persona 3R came out, that game is great but I think Metaphor really pushed the dev team to their limits and succeeded. Starting off with the bad: - The ending sort of becomes a little bit convoluted and ""anime-ish/generic"" but what do you expect from a JRPG? Especially from an ATLUS game, every ATLUS game ending will always go all out, and there's nothing wrong with that. Just wish some things were cleared up a little bit better, but by no means is it impossible to follow. I do think that the topic of ""anxiety"" becomes INSANELY overdone towards the end of the game, to the point where it IS THE GAME. Yes, people have anxieties but can we do it less generic? I'm sure FFXIV's Endwalker wasn't the first to do it but this game's finale really reminded me of it bar for bar. Like I said, it's a JRPG so I shouldn't be too surprised. - (NITPICK) Endgame grind is real and was kinda annoying to go through, especially facing the last 4 optional dragon bosses. They're entirely optional of course, but simply getting to the level where I could actually do stuff against them was a bit annoying. That is indeed a skill issue on my end though. Grinding in this game was definitely the lowest part but that's just because I wanted to complete everything on this play-through. This was entirely optional, and can be skipped. - I do wish the some of the dungeons were better laid out, the designs are really tedious to get around. I think this is a common complaint though so I'm not the only person who thinks of this. - Biggest gripe of this entire game is not being able to respec the main character, why? Several games give you the option to respec, why couldn't this one do it? Building a mage character, and having some of the best archetypes strictly doing phys damage is kinda annoying. However, every time you level up you do gain a random increase to a stat so that's good, it still remains balanced to an extent. I just feel like if the player (like me) regrets increasing a stat and not being able to change it back is just dumb. - Royal Archetype unlock requirements, ESPECIALLY FOR HEISMAY. WHY? - This might bug a lot of people out but for the social links (followers), Ranks 2-7 are not voiced which is a bit disappointing because all the VAs (in English) are fantastic and I would've loved to hear more of them. - SUPER NITPICKY but I absolutely hate that the game doesn't tell how to activate follower ranks, by that I mean some of the bonding scenes can ONLY happen on the gauntlet runner. - Another nitpick is that once in combat, you CANNOT open the main menu to reload, change your options, anything. It is super frustrating. - I do think the game can be really repetitive once you got the perfect party composition, but man, I just like hitting big numbers. The Good: - Art style; The first thing you see once you start the game. It's incredible what the artists did with this game and its designs. There's something so simple and designed on every single character, they're not too complicated nor boring, they're just perfect. Same goes for the monster (humans) designs, I know they're based off the paintings from Bosch, but seeing a human in this game is actually kinda jarring in a good way. They're so unique and I feel like that is what's needed in games nowadays, to just be WEIRD. The menu design, the painterly aesthetic, everything about this game is incredible to look at and is never an eye sore. What's really an eye sore is some of the animated cutscenes, my god, some are just... really bad. Still shouldn't distract from how well crafted everything looks in gameplay. - World building in a new IP will always be insanely difficult to pull off, especially when it's a fantasy game. Here they actually managed to not only create a well-put together world, but to have it actually be different from other games is incredible. A lot of people will call this game ""DEI crap"" but I really like how there's conflict and prejudice between each and every race. Going across the world you see how terrible everyone is to each other and it drives home the idea that you really need to fix what's going on and become king. There's also segments in the game where the party will stop in scenic locations and it's so cool to see landmarks throughout the world that aren't really explained. They're just, fantastical. - The Characters; I don't think I disliked any of the main cast at all, in-fact they're all really great characters. Surprisingly the ENG dub is really, really good? I've always found myself playing subbed JRPG games, but since this was a fantasy medieval-ish game I went with English. I'm actually kinda shocked that I can't listen to the JPN dub at all lol. Each character has their own conflict that you have to solve, and each bond provides an outlook on society; racism, hate, betrayal, loss of family, loss of trust, religion fanaticism, economic disparity, anxiety etc. In my opinion I believed there was never a dull moment, or a moment where the game just rubbed it in my face that ""le racism bad"". I do like the message of the game that fantasy can indeed be reality, but it needs time. My only pet peeve is that since this is an ATLUS game, only the main character can spend time with them one-on-one. Of course there are times where the party does come together and bond, but I really, really wish there was more of that because I do think they actually bond well with one another unlike certain games. Overall, great party, but I do wish Eupha's dialogue wasn't about magla 90% of the time. I do also wish that the MC had more of a personality trait than being the all-good optimistic character. Still, having a VA for the MC works wonders and he's not half bad either. - Louis, genuinely steals the show every time he's on screen. - The music is amazing and there's nothing else I need to say about it. - Gameplay is insanely fun once you get used to it. A lot of people will get turned off as soon as they see the archetype menu, but I personally think it's great. It has this mix of old FF games combined with obviously SMT/Persona and made a beautiful Metaphor baby. There's so many combinations to mix and match, my brain though is very small when it comes to tactical games so I didn't put it to its potential. However, the difficulty of the game is just perfect. I played this game on HARD and it's definitely the best difficulty for a new player, the game actually makes you think. I think early game is almost impossible, but once it hits, it hits. I've seen a few people complain about the MP issue and I saw almost none of that. If you run out of MP just take the day off the dungeon and return back? Anyways, this game was so fun to play it makes me actually want to play more turn-based RPGs. Also the inclusion of the front/back row is so awesome, would love to see more that in future games. In conclusion, I did enjoyed this game, and it was well worth the full-price I paid for. Will everyone like it? Obviously not, there are a lot more issues than what I stated, but having put 90 hours into completing almost everything was very fun. This is definitely one of Sega's best games to ever be released, and I'm so glad to have played it. Fantasy lives on.",2024-12-27 09:19:58,89.85,True,0,0,0,False,False,

The class system has a lot of depth, the game's turn system adds a lot of nuance and strategy that wasn't really seen in other Persona games, and above all else, its way of having you wipe out low-level scrubs without getting into turn-based combat at all keeps the game from becoming a slog. Only complaint is the dungeons are not nearly as interesting as they were in Persona 5. This is also my favorite story that Studio Zero has written. Doesn't suffer the same dips in pacing that other Persona games had, and has an amazing main villain that stays important throughout the whole tale. And of course, Atlus' solid character writing still remains in its 'followers' (think Social links). None of the followers were real duds to me, and some like Alonzo were absolutely phenomenal.

184015806,2679460,"The experience is like buying a €70 vinyl full of exquisite music and getting a game on top. This is not your typical game with a braindead amount of action but rather a story you can take part in and influence its course. The main story structure covers a wide variety of political, sociological, and anthropological questions. If you've ever played any of the Persona games, you will enjoy this. The different setting is satisfying, and the art direction, combined with the sound design, is wonderful. The combat music feels jumpy, ecstatic, and energetic, which helps you get into the fight even more. It is a perplexing and twisting story bearing deep messages. It constantly uses every tool at its disposal to pull you in and live out its story with the characters. It's a bit shorter than Persona 5 but doesn’t lack anything that Persona provides. I would say it even improves upon previous ATLUS segments. I really appreciated the Magla reward from dialogue options rather than relationship points. Also, killing lower-level enemies in overworld combat is a lot easier, which is a change I’ve longed to see. As with any JRPG, the gameplay gets repetitive after a while. However, for me, it only felt that way in the last 5 hours, meaning the game constantly throws new things at you to keep it fresh. But there are also downsides. Storywise, I really hated the first two weeks after the Opera incident. For some reason, it didn’t keep me as invested as other parts of the game. Also, the later party members [spoiler]Junah, Eupha, and Basilio[/spoiler]—felt very rushed. [spoiler]Basilio[/spoiler] especially. He comes in too late in the story, and getting to know him and integrating him into the party is awkward at best. His voiced opinions feel forced most of the time. [spoiler]Also, he recovers instantaneously from the death of his brother, which felt really out of place[/spoiler]. I absolutely agree with the directive decision to not provide a love interest option, as the story and setting are not fitting for such a mechanic. What I lacked in a world full of despair, anger, and injustice was violence. I expected the story to be more brutal. That would have been more polarizing and could have further portrayed the protagonist as the shining beacon of hope. We also lack any character that is downright evil. I missed having anyone as disturbed as Kamoshida from Persona 5. You would expect that the harsh world of Metaphor: Re Fantazio would produce more people like him. In the end, I would definitely recommend the game, even with its few painful parts. It was a brilliant ride. Go try it for yourself.

184070474,2679460,"8.5/10 First ever Atlus and turn-based game that isn't old school Pokemon. Finished the campaign in ~72 hours on normal difficulty. Game is very good and has some great characters, but at the same time has a lot of characters that i really didn't care about and doing their bond rankings was a drag so i just skipped it. I do not recommend this game if you don't like playing visual novels and there's A LOT of reading and it's hard to be engaged that long, especially given the length of the game. Criticism i have on the game is that the enemy and dungeon variety is poor, even all the dragons look sort of similar and has the same posture. At the end, they re-used the the humans that we've beaten already but slightly recoloured. They could have extended their imagination and made more different enemies and dungeons. At the end game, they literally made me go to the same dungeons that i was already at. Some dungeons are just way too long, especially the dragon temple which took me like 4 hours and 3 in-game days since i keep running out of MP and there isn't a good way to sustain MP without spending time farming, which i wished i did. I also didn't have enough time to get all the royal virtues and thus the royal archetypes, i thought i had enough time so i was focused on raising my combat stats whenever i had time in the Gauntlet, don't do this. I do wish this game was shorter and sweater, less dialogue diarrhea in between. The game also lacks some QoL features such as when i can save the game, pausing the cutscenes (there is a lot, sometimes i'm forced to sit through 20 minutes of cutscenes without the ability to pause or save, terrible QoL), and i can't access the main menu during combat. Some times i enter battle with a bad party and have to restrategize, but there's no way to load up an old save without Alt+F4 the game to go back to the title screen, super super annoying and discourages us from re-strategizing, especially annoying because strategizing is important to exploit enemy weaknesses. Last criticism i have on the game is how NG+ works, with how you have to re-unlock all the archetypes. The reason why i would want to play NG+ is because i want to experience my OP archetypes some more, but now i can't do that until end game when i earned those archetypes. Super lame and so i am unlikely to replay this game anytime soon, if ever. Also, fuck those skeleton mob, hard to avoid their ambush and i laugh everytime they get me (almost every time) because of how BS it is, they attack faster than you and have a very small window to attack or they lunge off screen so i don't even see them coming, and they're super strong when they ambush you. Good things about the game is the story, the animations, and characters. I especially loved the 30 fps animations that you get everyone once in awhile, i wish we got a lot more of that because obviously the graphics are very bad so those animations brought lots of clarity on the environment. Art style is very very good and i like the dark theme, but the poor graphics diminished it, hence why i liked the high resolution 30 fps animations/cut scenes. I also like how they tied this game to Etrian Odyssey, never played it and don't know what that game is until i watched a video on it and found it to be super cool. Overall, great game and a good experience into Atlus, i am now excited for their upcoming work. Will unlikely play their older games because they lack a lot of QoL that Metaphor has fixed such as how dialogue options work to increase bonds. I have a big issue with lots of QoL issues that Metaphor either has or lacks, so i can't imagine playing an older Atlus game which are even worse, sometimes, QoL issues is enough to steer me away from a game alone if there are either enough of them or bad enough. 1/11 STORY 🔲 Bad Story 🔲 Average 🔲 Good 🔲 Great ✅ FANTASTIC 2/11 GAMEPLAY 🔲 Lifeless/static 🔲 Poor 🔲 Average ✅ Good 🔲 Excellent 3/11 DIFFICULTY 🔲 Brain off 🔲 Relaxing ✅ Easy to learn / Hard to master 🔲 Difficult 🔲 Sekiro 4/11 GRIND 🔲 Nothing to grind ✅ Isn't necessary to progress 🔲 Average grind level 🔲 A lot of grind 🔲 Too much grind 5/11 GAME TIME / REPLAYABILITY 🔲 Short 🔲 Average ✅ Long 🔲 Near infinite 6/11 FIDELITY ✅ Low 🔲 Average 🔲 Good 🔲 Very Detailed 🔲 Near reality 7/11 ART STYLE/THEMATIC 🔲 Terrible 🔲 Good ✅ Beautiful 🔲 Cinematic 8/11 AUDIO/SOUNDTRACK 🔲 Earrape 🔲 Bad 🔲 Not too bad ✅ Good 🔲 Peak 9/11 PC REQUIREMENTS 🔲 Potato ✅ Low end 🔲 Medium end 🔲 High End 🔲 NASA 10/11 PRICE 🔲 Free 🔲 Wait for sale ✅ Worth the price 🔲 Best investment ever done 11/11 BUGS / CRASHES ✅ None that I can recount 🔲 Minor bugs/few crashes 🔲 Noticeable amount of bugs/Infrequent crashes 🔲 Filled with bugs/Frequent crashes 🔲 Complete mess",2024-12-29 06:40:16,73.4,True,0,0,0,False,False,

184199199,2679460,"Overall, I really enjoyed Metaphor. It's not perfect, but it's one of Atlus' better titles in recent years. A lot of that is due to the narrative, though; I have a lot of complaints about the mechanics of the so-called '35th anniversary game'. On the surface, a lot of the plot in the game is very trite. ""Humans are the real monsters"". ""Racism bad"". These aren't exactly new tropes, especially in fantasy. But Metaphor doesn't pretend to have the answers, and they meld the tropes in a way that's fairly unique in my experience. It feels...genuine? I don't know if that's exactly the right word for what I mean, but it's the closest. Part of it, too, is Louis; he is probably the most compelling antagonist Atlus has written, and is probably my favourite JRPG antagonist as of writing. But it's not just surface level. The story plays with a *lot* of tropes in neat little ways. The music you hear is diegetic, which actually becomes a minor plot point; the fluffy animal character is also the grizzled veteran; the protagonist's parents [spoiler]are dead *but* they still guide him post-mortem along the way (even if that's not known even to him until the end). Similarly, the protagonist's initial visage looking like a 10 year old's first fantasy OC is because...it is.[/spoiler]. To an extent, it even uses and explains a Deus Ex Machina effectively. [spoiler]The player is the Deus Ex Machina.[/spoiler]. It's not perfect, though. It's inevitably going to draw parallels to Persona, and that's not completely invalid since it ultimately still follows the Fool's Journey (although it speedruns the section from The Tower onwards). There's a part in the story that was (IMO) *very obviously* cut content. And as much as I loved it as an Etrian Odyssey fan, the fourth act's reference is brazen. Like, I got spoiled on the setting's twist *listening to the soundtrack as the game downloaded because I recognised the song.* As soon as I descended the stairs, I brought up EO1's map of the floors and found them identical. (Well, mostly.) Hell, I even bypassed most of the dungeon in the same way you can in the original (albeit more easily due to it being an ARPG dodge-roll as opposed to a tough FOE fight). I know EO is Atlus' least-recognized JRPG series, and Re:Fantazio is their anniversary game so it had to have a reference somewhere, but I can think of several better ways to do it. As for mechanics, I'm conflicted. As I said above, I have complaints. But it's not all bad. I like Press Turn, and that's legitimately enough to make the combat fun for me. The Archetype system allows for some really neat (and potentially broken) combinations without being overbearing for those coming from easier Atlus titles like Persona. But I do have a *lot* of complaints. Firstly, a minor one is that a lot of the Archetypes feel like fodder for the four floating skills options you get, with no intentions on actually being used as a main Archetype. Atlus knows by now that physical weaknesses in Press Turn is a trap option, and yet they put them on several of them! However, my main complaint is that, even though this is allegedly Atlus' 35th anniversary game, the majority of the mechanics feel like Persona 5 + Press Turn, with every character getting the Wild Card but a significantly limited pool of Personas. Like, sure, you've got... [list] [*] Megami Tensei skill names [*] A skill system a la Digital Devil Saga [*] A front and back row system a la Etrian Odyssey (and some older SMT titles) [*] Archetypes that - at least superficially - reference other games. [/list] But the problem is that all of those are relatively inconsequential. Cool, fire spells are named 'Bot' instead of 'Agi', you made maybe fifteen people happy and made the rest of them think you randomly renamed some of them. I know I certainly did until someone informed me. Cool, you have a class system you can change on the fly. That's never been done before in the history of JRPGs. /s Cool, moving to the back row increases defense, and a couple Archetypes use the system. But there are *three spells* that meaningfully interact with it beyond moving everyone forward and backward, and only a single type of enemy (the chickens) care about it. The defense boost isn't substantial enough to really care, either,. (In EO, physical damage is halved *at the end of the calculation* if the target is in the back row.) And, to cap it all off, the one Archetype line that *really* uses it is one of the weakest in the game. Oh, speaking of: I'm not kidding about some Archetypes being 'superficial' references. Yes, the Gunner, Sniper, and Dragoon in EO all use either a gun or a bow. They're also, in order, *physical*-based elemental damage dealers, crit specialists/binders, and tanks. The Gunner line in Metaphor is none of these, albeit partly because the game doesn't have binds. At least it has ailment skills, but ailments aren't useful in Persona-style games for the player to use. At least the Masked Dancer and Summoner use inferences to create their items (with Dancer items referencing the Major Arcana and Summoner items referencing different demon Races), and they feature cameos of sorts...but most effects aren't unique. There also isn't really a tie to Soul Hacker's namesake beyond the name itself either AFAIK. Finally, there's difficulty options. I solemnly swear by the idea that you should balance around your hardest difficulty, and Atlus has a...schizophrenic history of doing that. Etrian Odyssey is nearly perfect in that regard, since the highest difficulty is always the intended experience, judging by the numbers behind the scenes. Nocturne's a good example of them *not* doing that, given Hard has a reputation of killing you several times in the tutorial fight. Now, I don't know what difficulty Metaphor was balanced around (the game's pretty easy beyond the optional bosses' insta-kill nonsense), but I *do* know that I want to throttle whoever decided the MAG costs for Archetypes should be doubled on the NG+ difficulty. Regicide also leans a lot heavier into a much more boring playstyle, and it's exclusively due to the 2x multiplier on Weak and Critical hits applied exclusively to your party. Sorry, I'm not taking an Archetype I can't hide the weakness of. Now, how would I change the game to improve it? I wouldn't necessarily do all of this, but... - Make buffs last until dispelled a la most SMT games - Add the three binds from EO, with the Gunner line now specialising in them. Probably also buff ailments in general for the player's benefit. - Add more area-of-effect options that hit only a row. This would interact interestingly with Press Turn's weakness system (since you could, for example, put someone Weak in the same row as someone who Repels a type, which is an interesting trade-off if the AI always targets weaknesses) - [strike]Bring back Smirking[/strike] TL;DR Basically Persona but with a more 'adult' narrative, like everyone thought it would be.

184379343,2679460,"Story 10/10 Music 10/10 But everything else... um........... This is the closest thing you'll get to Persona 6. (Or maybe this is Persona 6 in disguise?) However, ATLUS accidentally set an incredibly high standard with Persona 5, and in their effort to surpass it, they may have tried a bit too hard. The art style is... I don't know. The overuse of particle effects and poor anti-aliasing (or lack thereof at launch) makes the graphics more of a PM 2.5 on-screen. Instead of being visually captivating, the game ends up visually overwhelming. MP management is an issue throughout the game. Despite being set in a magical world (you can even see PM 2.5 on the screen, remember?), the game provides players with a frustratingly scarce amount of MP. While the first two or three towns are manageable, the fourth dungeon introduces an absurd difficulty spike. Grinding becomes unavoidable, but grinding requires MP—and without MP, combat is virtually impossible. To whoever designed that [spoiler]Dragongrace Shinjuku[/spoiler] dungeon, I hate you. This scarcity is compounded by: - The necessity to use MP for combat mechanics that rely on trial and error to identify enemy weaknesses. - High MP costs for essential skills. - No reliable way to replenish MP within dungeons. - All the genius enemy AI that will always ""Critical"" ""Weakness"" you. Or spam all the BS skills like ""gained four turns icon"" IDK, maybe the game wants you to save up all that precious MP and try to avoid unnecessary fights thus finding a way to the boss room as quickly as possible? This instead leaves you stuck in a dilemma: conserve MP and risk being under-leveled, or deplete resources and struggle to progress. [spoiler]The Dragongrace Shinjuku[/spoiler] dungeon is a prime example of poor design. Its maze-like layout is overly complicated, making navigation confusing and frustrating. Adding to the misery, the area is filled with an overwhelming number of monsters that seem disproportionately strong for the player's level at that stage. The combination of excessive encounters and disorienting design makes this dungeon one of the most unpleasant experiences in the game. (At the time of writing, only 47.5% of players able to clear this stupid dungeon) The game's economy is another pain point. Money is needed for weapons, armor, potions, and food, but earning enough is a hard. The game provided you an option to trade MAG for money but there’s NO option to exchange money for MAG (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻ , which is vital for leveling archetypes. When combined with the MP shortage issue and the game's time management mechanics. This leads to frustrations more than a challenge. Maybe we have to wait for Metaphor: ReFantazio Reloaded/Royal/Remaster/Re-fantasy edition of this game so that everything is better balanced. but as it stands, the game difficulty is a nightmare to play even on normal [b]Final Recommendation[/b] Save yourself the frustration and replay Persona 5 ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/pasathaioum5/recommended/1687950]the original, not the Royal edition[/url]). It’s a far more enjoyable experience. But if you really, really want to challenge yourself and have time and really love ATLUS's game, go ahead and enjoy. DO NOT read below If you haven’t played the game yet or haven’t finished it, [spoiler] The decision to set the game in a post-apocalyptic world, reminiscent of Horizon Zero Dawn and Xenoblade Chronicles, initially seemed like a promising story direction. However, the game fails to fully utilize this setting to it full extent - Why did it end? Just a war? - What caused it? Just anxiety? - Is there any way/possible to go back and live in the old world? - Is any important knowledge left behind? Just Elda's knowledge and some mural? - Why the old world is underground? And with full sky and water even) Instead, focusing only on the quest to defeat/stop the villain (That may also be a good thing, I guess) Still... that leaves the post-apocalyptic world setting feeling more like a surprise to the player rather than an integral part of the story.

183910446,2679460,"(This review contains mild spoilers) - This game is really something else—ranging from the artwork, the UI/UX, characters, story, worldbuilding, soundtrack, gameplay, and bringing everything together into an incredible piece of art. I could talk about this game for days, but my most honest wish for you who might be reading this is: play it, give it a try, and beat it. If you are a fan of jRPGs or just RPGs in general, this game delivers it all, and it's one of those games that might change your perspective on some matters of life. The game delivers a strong and solid pacing and will always leave you wanting more or guessing what's going to happen when the next deadline of the calendar arrives. There are plenty of side quests to take part in and see the world grow into something alive. The battle system and overworld battle are fun and condense years of learning of what works and doesn't work in jRPGs—Metaphor's combat, leveling, gameplay, and quality of life systems are what every modern jRPG needs instead of clinging to traditional outdated designs (such as random unavoidable encounters). The soundtrack is excellent, and while I wish I could rate it as a ""masterpiece,"" I cannot if I'm going to be honest. This game has some SERIOUS bangers on it (the battle theme is an obvious choice here), but at some point, the game keeps recycling some songs over and over, and I wish they invested in more variety to make some moments feel different. Shoji Meguro never disappoints in the quality of his work, though. The menus (UI/UX) of the game are on a whole other level. It's nothing new that Atlus delivers an incredible visual and gameplay-focused experience in this department, and Metaphor's UI is not an exception here. I've read some people saying the menus are convoluted, too busy, or confusing, but in my opinion, they are very much well-placed according to the game's motifs and themes—everything blends well together, every menu has a purpose and integrates into a piece of art that is there to afford a new look into the characters, their choices, and the world itself. They are fluid, easy to navigate, and visually pleasing. I will leave a critique here though—some quality of life features could be implemented, such as skipping archetype-acquiring scenes after you've seen them before, enabling the player to spend more than one Heroic Fruit/Leaf/Root for leveling an archetype at once, etc. The leveling and class system are wonderful and provide you with plenty of choices as you build your characters, however, it falls short near the endgame where you start unlocking the Royal Archetypes, making all previous archetypes just stepping stones to build extra skills on these ""final"" archetypes. I wish they found a way to keep classes interesting and make you choose different ones the same way they did throughout the majority of the game, where you had to switch and mix and match builds to adapt to enemies' weaknesses and tactics. After you get a Royal Archetype, there's no other choice—it's simply the best one you can have. Characters (main and supporting cast) are very well designed with different themes, with interesting personalities and intriguing backstories that develop further and further as you play the game. Some characters have really tragic events and story beats happening to them, for which I commend the writers for not backing down on some tough decisions, allowing for death to actually be lethal and permanent, for loss to be felt and mourned, for retribution to shine at its right moment, and so on. I really dislike when games kill someone just to bring that person back in a couple of minutes again, taking off all the pressure and the impact the scene had (this happens in the main quest once, but I can accept it in the context it happened). The world feels alive and interesting, most places have distinct visuals and themes for you to interact with, with lots of NPCs and side stories happening while they converge into the main quest motif. Not everything is perfect in this game though, the game has a few hiccups in some moments of the main story and suffers from one of the most severe lacks of interesting dungeon designs when we look at the side/optional dungeons. They are just empty corridors or mazes that stretch forever with little to no puzzles or other interesting vistas/rooms to interact with. This is what bothered me the most about this game—the main dungeons are very well dressed, designed, and they have a good amount of content, challenges, and interesting story or side-events happening. However, the side dungeons are just empty, with old ruins seemingly like they hire someone to clean them weekly because they don't even have skulls, cobwebs, dust or all sorts of stuff lying around telling a story about its past. The towers are just the same copy-pasted tower all over again, with a slight color variation. For a game with that much love poured into it, I feel like this department was really not interested in making these side parts of the game shine to their true potential. Really disappointing. The second point which deserves critique is the endgame story beats—don't get me wrong, the story itself is spectacular and very well written. However, by the end, it seems the writers of the dialogues lost their hand and hammered the same messages, values, and descriptions over and over on your head as a player to make sure you got it. Yes, we know about anxiety fueling Magla, yes, we understand that fear of the unknown fosters bad things in people and gives rise to despair, yes, we understand that near the final confrontation it's inevitable for friends and allies to reminisce about their hardships along the journey. They clearly overdid this, which is usually very present in jRPGs or other similar media, to the point I was like ""Man, I love this game but please I don't want to see the characters taking rounds and talking about their emotions and hardships for 3-4 different scenes with the same message shoved in, get on with it."" Alas, the final point which deserves critique is related to all confrontations against Louis. In general, I believe the game does a good job of making Louis an interesting villain and making you actually fight him in different stages of your (and his) strength. However, it does feel at a certain point the game is just using Louis as a carrot on a stick to keep you moving forward, maybe if they tuned down the number of confrontations against him to make them more impactful, that would be better. At some point, it just starts rubbing you in the wrong way where he's like ""Ok see ya bozos, I'm running again but I will be waiting for you, AGAIN."" Like, what the hell? We are here, man, let's just fight for real. It's artificial, it's uninspired. Really reminds me of the whole hook of FF7's cast pursuing the shadow and clues about Sephiroth and JENOVA all over again. Despite my critiques, I'm giving this game a 5/5 for everything it has presented and delivered—no game is ever without its flaws and that's what makes it a human piece of art. It certainly could be better, the lows are low and the strong points really shine through. Metaphor is really a strong entry into the jRPG universe and a marking in Atlus' history. It delivers an important message about themes related to mental health, faith, personal values, outlooks on life, politics, friendship, and the importance of being true to yourself, facing your inner challenges and emotions to channel the better version of you.",2024-12-27 19:58:43,88.75,True,0,0,0,False,False,
183642675,2679460,"This game does a very poor job at onboarding people to this kind of games. Usually, I'm not attracted to that kind of art style and the ""japanese way"" of telling stories around battles. However, I liked what I saw at the game awards and in the trailers on steam, so I decided to give it a shot and hoped to maybe find a liking to this kind of games. Almost 2 hours into the prolog, the actual GAMEPLAY time was about 10-15 minutes max. The remaining 100 Minutes were dialogs and cut scenes that actually add very little to move the plot forward, 80% of it was mostly filler and repetition, diluting the actual plot, making it uninteresting. In addition, the fights have too many UI animations (mostly transition animations to go from one battle step to the next), which distracted from the important information of the UI. Maybe something I might have gotten used to, I don't know, but it matches the game's constant use of transition overlays between dialog sequences. The whole UI experience seems to suffer from ADHD. I'm not saying that this is a bad game in total, but it has a terrible tutorial and onboarding experience and definitely doesn't help to make the genre accessible to people who aren't already fond of it.",2024-12-25 11:23:42,1.73,False,2,1,0.47,False,False,

183952004,2679460,"[h1]Fun Yet Non-Final Fantasy[/h1] [b]TLDR:[/b] Fun for Atlus RPG fans, but has some serious problems and utterly screams [i]""We are pushing out a Plus Edition within two years""[/i] on several points. Buy it if you catch it on sale, otherwise you're probably safe to wait to not have to buy it 'twice' for the content. [h2]Pro's in short:[/h2] [list] [*]Press Turn System from Shin Megami Tensei is superior to One More System from Persona, I will die on this hill. [*]Fans of Persona 5's presentation will eat well. Art style is very 'Aura Battler Dunbine' mixed with 'Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water' with a good chunk of worldbuilding. [*]Followers/Social Links no longer require a Guide to progress, they do so automatically so long as you have enough Virtues/story progression. Correct dialogue choices only give bonuses to MAG/secondary currency. [*]Archetypes allow for full customization of every party member's playstyle to a point, and allow for more on-the-fly mix-and-match tactics for teambuilding to prepare for challenges. No need to find a Fusion Calculator! [*]Gallica is cute. [/list] [h2]Con's in short:[/h2] [*]You will drown in dialogue, the game is extremely text-heavy as the game loves to Tell and not Show. Majority of Followers/Social Links are not voiced either. On a plus side, the Protagonist CAN talk at last, but usually gets everyone else to dialogue for him outside of choices so why bother? [*]Real Time Battle is very droll and kind of clunky, especially around Magla Crystal Spawners come the midgame. It's just swing and a dodge-roll, nothing remotely in-depth, and some animations will get you slapped by a skeleton sliding half a mile across the floor. [*]There's a lot of reused assets here. Non-major dungeons and a good chunk of enemies will be seeing pallete-swaps. Some more than once. [*]The music is mid. The tracks with chanting give those good Strange Journey vibes and the main battle theme gives the game a distinct identity, but most other tracks are forgettable. Meguro's still good but it feels like the fantasy genre is holding him back in a way. Also the Human Boss theme is just bad/boring. [*]Follower ranks form a nasty chokepoint on Archetypes rather quickly in terms of Inheritance slots or upgrades. The game also really likes to try to force you into picking up Magic early on due to mission structures if you want any skill slots, and not allowing you to get a dedicated/good Magic party member until the [spoiler]FIFTH[/spoiler] teammate joins. [*]There are some performance issues, particularly regarding the Gauntlet Runner or Brilehaven at times. Thankfully the battle sequences don't seem to suffer from it but weaker PCs might have some trouble. [*]The game will get awful preachy about politics, and that's an integral part of the game. I personally didn't mind it, hell I liked it, but it's about as un-subtle as a hammer on an anvil at times. Some folks might not like that sort of thing, so fair warning. As an aside, I feel like the game didn't go far enough in regards to some topics and themes especially early on... [*]Archetypes are janky when it is time to switch. Any time you switch Archetypes in the menu, you will be forced to switch out their gear, which means you have to tediously go back and switch out every single piece of equipment one by one. Did I mention that some gear types outside of the weapons are locked to specific Archetypes? It would have been nice to have a 'save this kit for this Archetype' function instead of forcing them to just slap on whatever has the highest Attack/Defense blindly. [*]Gallica will simply [i]NOT SHUT UP[/i] during Squad Battle. Gods help you if you have a debuff or someone has more than a paper cut's worth of damage, because she will pipe up about it EVERY SINGLE TURN. In fact, no, ALL of your party members will constantly fret and freak out on the field if you walk around with more than 10% of your health gone for more than five seconds. It gets very annoying since apparently THOSE are the voiced quotes but not any of the quest-relevant chatter? [/list] [h2]The BIG Con:[/h2] Anyone who's played the game to completion can freely read but a single word here: [spoiler]Altabury.[/spoiler] For those who hadn't but want a cliffnotes version without spoilers, the game basically dances around AT LEAST two specific points where story dungeons were clearly cut from the game to get a release out. It's pretty egregious because they will give you the boss fights 'outside' of those locations but skimp out on the buildup. They also manage to pull this sort of stunt twice in a row in quick succession which left a bad taste in my mouth. The first half of the game starts off rather strong and then someone just snapped the brake line in the second half in an effort to hit the finish faster. It very much felt like those sections in particular are meant to be what the usual [i]Atlus Re-Release With New Heroine Duct Taped On Top[/i] stunt is supposed to patch in, and I'm a little tired of it at this point. It's for that particular last reason that I can say this: If you like Atlus RPGs, you'll love this, but please only try to buy this when it's on sale at most. I'd be shocked if they don't try to push out a new version before 2026 with a bunch of extra content on. I give it three Decarabia out of five. Good game but, again, feels like it's not complete....",2024-12-28 05:00:37,166.33,True,1,0,0.52,False,False,
183895085,2679460,"I just closed the game from having beaten it. The short version is that this is a great game. The longer version is kind of hard to put into words. There are so many things about this game that are odd and weird, but not in a bad way. Down to the very battle theme, things are very unexpected. And I usually don't like the air quotes, ""deep"" games that get into metaphysical concepts. Like the differences between what is fantasy and what is reality, but just a little bit of suspension of disbelieve really goes a long way for this game. It allows you to really get into the world-building and character development on offer, which I can't overstate how great it is. I'm the kind of guy who never really talks to NPCs or will even flip through some dialog if I feel like I ""get the point."" But I found myself engaged and interested than usual, which should speak volumes alone. I'm a pretty big fan of the SMT series and have been ever since Nocturne. And I say this because I actually don't like the Persona series. I bring this up because I feel there's probably a small subset of Megaten fans in the same boat. It's pretty clear that there are a lot of Persona elements in the game, from the time progression to the social aspect of raising level with followers. But Metaphor actually seems to pick mechanics, themes, and systems from across the franchise. And I'm glad to say that this did not impact my enjoyment of the game. I was far more interested in emboldening my allies towards the greater cause than I ever was trying to get Ann Takamaki to go on a date with me. While the system, in theory, isn't much different, just losing the skin of a slice-of-life high schooler completely fixed this for me. And I'd hate someone missing out because they had the same concerns and passed on this. The game, though, isn't without some of it's issues. The thing that bugged me the most is (and this may be considered a spoiler by some people, so fair warning) towards the end of the game, you will unlock special archetypes unique to each character. But those characters have to have trained in many other archetypes to unlock. If throughout the playthrough, you didn't focus the right set of archetypes, you are very likely not going to be able to experience these as having to train up multiple archetypes from square one is just not feasible. Specially considering most of the prerequisite classes require OTHER archetypes be leveled as well. It feels punishing for not being able to see the future. But other than a few other nit-picks not really even worth mentioning, the game is a great experience and I can see why it was nominated for game of the year.",2024-12-27 17:03:11,97.68,True,2,0,0.53,False,False,

However after slightly over 2-months of fairly sustained gameplay, I have now (along with most of my guild and alliance) quit this game. I am a big fan of PVP gameplay in MMORPG games and have played almost every MMORPG since 2002. While T&L looked very promising for its PVP gameplay, it soon became apparent that unless your whole guild had low ping, all players turned up for every fight, and ran auto-block macros. You would not be able to compete with the other guilds from mega-alliances which will bring players in in the last minute to fill their roster, so they are always fighting with 70 players. Furthermore, if you are a Kiwi or Australian - I would NOT recommend this game as the ping is average at best, even with the use of ExitLag, and the Boonstone/Riftstone fights are very late for us (1am for Kiwis) and therefore not realistic. Plus the Maintenance of this game, makes the game unplayable every Thursday during our prime-time. Pros: - The graphics in this game are stunning! The game is visually beautiful. - Boonstone/Riftstone PVP fights can be really fun if you have a good guild to play with. - The Main Story Quest storyline was quite interesting and impressive. Cons: - Game may not be Pay to Win, but it is definitely pay-to-save-a-boat-load-of-time. - Botting and Players using Macros are rampant (and very obvious) in this game. - The Dev's dont appear to care about players cheating at all. - Mega Alliances and Hand-Holding make most of the open-world Boss content rather boring. - For Aussies and Kiwis, dont expect to play the game on Thursdays during prime-time as this is when the global maintenance happens. - The Oceanic servers are based in Asia, not Oceania - therefore the ping for Oceanic players is terrible.",2024-12-07 21:42:22,515.87,False,2,0,0.52,False,False,

182363316,2429640,"I will begin with I loved this game. But unfortunately: 1. It became unenjoyable for me ever since last update (Runes Update) You have to keep grinding multiple runs in just for a chance to level up the runes you have and it's all randomized. I'm not saying 1 or 2 runs, 10 or 20 runs What I'm talking about you need hundreds and hundreds of run to maximize your runes. 2. It feels stupid you separated normal 2-star dungeon tokens and dimensional trials. You get 900 tokens a day, 450 tokens per run, so total 2 runs daily then what? I have to go back grinding dimensional trials for runes again. Why won't you make it so that we can open chest at the end of dimensional trial?????????? 3. It feels retarded that you changed weekly dungeon mission. first tier: 4500 token spent second tier: 10 dimensional trial runs third tier: 15 dimensional trial runs totalling between 35 to 50 dungeon runs a week! WE ARE NOT CORPORATE SLAVES! i know some of you will say ""you can farm runes by doing field bosses and dynamic events"" yeah you tell me how many hundreds of times you have to do that to maximize your gear? My suggestions: 1. Make it so that we can spend our tokens at the end of dimensional trial runs, put the chest in there! 2. Bring back old dungeon weekly mission, so we are not forced to grind and still get max rewards! TL;DR Many of your spenders come from working class, don't make our lives harder! We lack time!

Currently, the endgame is the PvP and in its current incarnation I can't really recommend it. The developers have over-emphasized AOE abilities, making large fights monochromatic. Player survivability is abysmal. Moreover, Arena combat plays completely differently(because it's 3v3 only) so you're forced to have separate equipment sets. You're forced to have a separate set to efficiently farm PvE, this means you have at least 3 sets if you choose to engage in all content efficiently. You need even more if you're looking to use different weapon combos. Of course, you get a few equipment presets for free but if you want more, you must pay. That pretty much sums up the whole game.

182638727,2429640,"(lucent is ingame currency that you can pay for with real money, you can use it to buy items off marketplace or itemshop) After some time invested i can clearly say that this game is totaly guild orientated. All yo do is hit lvl 50 via quest and before you join guild you can do only dungeons, open dungeons and world bosses also some openworld events but all of these is limited somehow how ever if you join guild this thing changes. You get additional ""world bosses"" that you can kill weekly with your guys, you can fight for some terrains on map and here the real problem begins. If you want to join guild like this you need to join startign guild or pay lucent to level your gear fast because no matter how good you are in this game, 70% is weapon combo that you have choosen and gear you are wearing. If you somehow get to play with hardcore pvp guild you are obligated to play almost as part time job because if you missed at least 1 guild event and have no time to message on discord or somehow, you are going to get kicked from the guild. But lets say something more about guilds directly. So main purpose of being in guild is to attend to these guild activities wherte you fight for some terrain on the map but for yourself you do it mainly to get lucent to grow in game faster or to drop items from bosses, but in reality you mostlikely will not get any items from your guild because, these items are limited by number of bosses you can kill weakly and distribution of these items is BY GUILD OWNERS so yes they decide that who get the item. even if you drop it they can take it for themselves but if you are kind a believer you can wait until owners and their frinds feed enough and MAYBE they will give you something but not necessarerly because they can also sell this items on marketplace directly and get lucent... :). Ok but what if you have a job? Like real life one? If you do shifts you are going to miss 95% OF ALL THE EVENTS in game because most important events are scheduled between 18-22 (6pm-10pm) and ofcourse if you miss them you are not getting anything. But ok lets assume that you have pack of great frinds and all is ok and you created guild with them, you grow and grow, and finaly join some battles for control over some area and you loose, well you wont get anything for participation in it but that not a problem because it takes time to get better but soon you notice one thing, leaderboards of guild. Yes you look there and see that almost whole map is controlles by one guild but how? Game prevents you from doing more than 1 battle at the time. Well you see, it does prevent you from this but not from creating 2nd the same guild with one letter changed in it and youcreate huge guild because you add it to you friendly list ant that way you create instead of 70ppl max capatity guild emmmm 280ppl capacity guild. and this you will face on the worlbosses which are main thing to drop best in slot items for you build, and ofcourse the system which rewards you is totaly at their side because there is so called contribution which generally speaking do... if you and your guild kill the most of other people arpound they gain contribution over the boss and their chances are increasing BUT people who die or guilds that are loosing to this huge guild alliance THEY are loosing their contribution so besically you are loosing more and more chance to drop ANYTHING from the boss. It's so called gate keep. OK but lets talk about solo content in game: there is no such a content, you cannot grind alone and even if you are strong enouggh (for example call shadowmancer can do it) you are still limited by tokens that allows you to kill mobs xDDDD. Closed dungeons are trash they are boring and repetitive chances for items are drasticly low so most of regular players will have to do it multipletimes. So dont take vacation at work just to do it because its also limited per day. There is a pity system but to grind eanything this way well.. it takes like 8 days to get one item which. Last thing is about gear well, if you drop something this item recives some trait (additional stat) and this traits are randomized from 8 avaiable its quite fair because you mostly get most important ones so here its ok but the thing is, each item can upgrade one trait max 3 times so if you got like trait that gives you 150HP you can upgrade it to 600HP. You can have 3 different traits in one item and here last problem begins, to place another trait either you have to drop EXACTLY the same item but with different trait and combine them or use special stones to unlock this traits AND of course these stones are locked behing paywall and grind in the same time because you can get them only from litograph book (this is like book where you put different items and you get some better items) or you can buy season pass to get this. There is one more method you can craft them at any merchant but to do it you need to use pity tokens that you can use to craft your most wanted gear so.... I quit this game because there is nothing for people that want to have fun of playing because all of PVP and guild system is connected with stressing and grinding everyday.",2024-12-13 12:21:54,260.43,False,0,0,0,False,False,

It is possible to close the round in 1 hit, followed by a combo, wall carry and wall combo and then 1-2 wrong guesses for the defender.

Heihachi was a questionable character to have him back, like Jun, but it is still kinda okay I guess since the Tekken story had always been whack. But Clive...

My landlord asked about my strange footwork in the hallway; I responded with a sliding roundhouse kick and claimed 'frame advantage.' By month one, I was banned from every mall in the area for crouch-dashing into fountain displays and 'intimidating mannequins.' I now backdash during conversations and wave dash to the fridge.

182698242,1778820,"I don't usually write reviews, however with the current state of the Tekken Community review bombing the game; I wanna counter that. So if you aren't aware this game had suffered to review bombing twice already now. Once during TGU and together with the game not giving a dlc map for free. Things to take note this is my first officially own Tekken game, I know for a fact that dlc maps are paid before hand. And the fine print on Tekken 8 did not mention including any maps for free yet people get upset. I read them. TGU however is quite dumb for the Tekken Team for disqualifying players that got in the tournament despite their regions not being allowed to participate. So yah I understand that backlash. However as of right now I just think it's stupid of people complaining about the new DLC character Clive and then review bombing the game again; people like to complain about this game too much despite them saying ""I'm not gonna play the game anymore"", "" The game isn't balance"", ""this isn't tekken anymore"". Here's what I have to say, the game is great nonetheless of the negativity that this game receives there is a constant player base that never stops playing it. That includes me. More than that the game continue to improve itself little by little. The balancing could be tweak more yes but balances shouldn't be rush. And the last major balance update this game had made things fairly great. It's not perfect however they are trying. As I've said little steps. Anyway I think I'm getting over my self. What I'm trying to say is this game is fun. Nonetheless what people say or like to complain about. For all the people who keeps complaining you can go somewhere else; we don't want you here. This is the best Tekken game so far. I wanna applaud the Tekken 8 team for not giving up for admitting there mistakes and even trying to compensate the players for said mistakes. I wan't to let the Tekken 8 Team, Harada, Murray, know that despite all the negativity people throw at them that I am here and its players supporting them.

As the leader of a civilization, players guide their people from the ancient era to the modern age, competing through culture, science, domination, or diplomacy. With its colorful presentation and smart systems, Civ VI delivers one of the most engaging strategy experiences to date. The gameplay mechanics are excellent, with major innovations like the District System, which requires players to carefully plan cities by placing specialized districts on the map for optimal growth. This adds a new layer of strategy to city-building and forces players to think ahead about space and resources. The addition of Eureka Moments for research, Governors, and Loyalty systems further deepens gameplay. While there’s a learning curve to managing these mechanics, they make each decision feel impactful and rewarding. Gameplay earns a solid 9/10. The narrative is largely emergent, driven by the player’s choices and the rise and fall of civilizations throughout the ages. While it lacks a structured story, the sandbox experience allows players to craft their own alternate histories. Competing leaders with their unique agendas add personality to the campaign, but the storytelling remains secondary. Narrative earns a 7/10. Visually, Civ VI adopts a bright and stylized aesthetic that distinguishes it from its predecessors. While some players may prefer more realistic visuals, the art style is clean, charming, and easy to navigate. The detailed animations for leaders and units bring life to the world, earning graphics an 8/10. The sound and music are outstanding, with each civilization receiving its own theme that evolves as the ages progress. The soundtrack is beautifully composed, and the atmospheric sound effects—whether from bustling cities or battles—add immersion to the experience. This dimension scores a strong 9/10. Replayability is where Civilization VI truly excels. With countless civilizations to choose from, procedurally generated maps, and various victory conditions, no two games feel the same. Expansions like Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm further enrich the experience with new mechanics like Loyalty, natural disasters, and diplomatic victories. Replayability earns a perfect 10/10. Innovation is strong, with the District System, new victory conditions, and expanded diplomacy providing meaningful changes to the core formula. While Civ VI builds on the foundation of its predecessors, these additions add enough freshness to keep it engaging. Innovation scores an 8/10. In summary, Civilization VI is a standout entry in the legendary series, combining deep strategy with a visually appealing and highly replayable experience. The introduction of districts and new mechanics adds a fresh layer of challenge, while the vibrant presentation and excellent music make it a joy to play. Whether you’re a longtime fan or new to the series, Civ VI offers a compelling and endlessly replayable journey through history.",2024-12-17 22:01:19,111.63,True,0,0,0,False,False,

183065710,289070,"If strategy games are your thing, then Sid Meier's Civilization VI is an absolute phenomena. The game is a perfect cocktail of strategy, historical depth and imagination. You have to lead a civilization throughout the ages. From how to win a war, to how to progress science or culture; the strategic options are limitless. The stand out feature of CIV VI has to be the number of different ways to play the game. If you are an expansionist militarist, or a peaceful builder who won in a culture-dominated race, or even a diplomatic strategist – there is a route for you. Every civ has its own capabilities and units which makes every approach unique. The graphics is great, with a new bright and colourful style compared to old versions. The likeliness of the world is astonishing because the maps are very artistic, and the cities are teeming with life. At certain levels, it becomes easy to forget the world you are in as you concentrate on the details of your cities, armies and various wonders you have built. The new district system is also a fun twist, as it makes planning how a city will look and function a more entertaining part of the game. It is interesting to consider how to organize areas such as science or entertainment centers in order for them to function properly which adds another level when taking care of the city. The only bad thing I can think of is that the game can at some points be badly intimidating and feel overwhelming for new players. You have to learn the game in order to enjoy it, just like other strategy games like Hearts of Iron or Europa Universalis.",2024-12-18 20:23:37,23.78,True,0,0,0,False,False,

The cost of performing an action with a unit was viewable in advance so you could plan for it. The benefit of performing an action was explicit. The benefit of engaging in diplomacy with the AI was clear. In Civilization 6, none of that information is presented to the player, and if you actively search for it, it's impossible to find. Costs are given in turns to completion instead of hard numbers, which makes any progression practically invisible. Terrain improvement is terribly curtailed and unit movement is an absolute joke. Any feel of the map, the world, and my place in it, is a complete writeoff. Everything I hated about Beyond Earth is still here.

Right now GGG is really experimenting and trying stuff. If you want to try the campaign, it will probably get better later and it will have more Acts, because right now it's Act 1-3 with a ""new game+"" to get you leveled enough for maps. Maps are known as ""waystones"" here and it clearly is not the final idea for endgame. There are very OP stuff being abused and breaking the economy. You may not care for economy, but Solo Self Found is horrible right now. There is 0 deterministic crafting which is very difficult for SSF players. Rolling is almost useless in the endgame, so the ""souls-like"" experience is only for campaign. The build diversity is very lacking, if you build armor/life you are basically handicapped and the skill gems restrictions makes stats stacking the only viable option to test more skill combinations. There are many, really many balance problems. One-hit kill and on death mechanics gets crazy in end-game.

184373089,2694490,"TL;DR: There are issues on the horizon with the game's soulslike systems and endgame, and it'll come down to GGG admitting their ideas don't work and changing direction, or doubling down on their 'vision', a vision that has a very niche appeal. It's tough to review half a game, but that's kind of where we are right now. As it stands, the game is fine from the perspective of the experience from act 1-3 on both difficulties, but there are major issues that have to be addressed with endgame and looming issues with some of the games core systems. To save a bunch of words, the current endgame is best described as 'Hardcore mode light' and requires a very different play style than what was required in the first section of the game. Even if it's a placeholder endgame, its not acceptable game design in a world where Diablo 4 exists. One shot to clear a map, XP death penalties, a downgrade of gear on subsequent attempts to clear maps, and the fact you are at the mercy of RNG to get the items that even let you attempt to clear maps beyond tier 1. Its a game killer, and they need to address it. This leads into the other half of issues. To be short, they Souls'd it up, and didn't balance it properly. High damage/insta-kill attacks with barely visible telegraphs due to the games dark aesthetic. The dodge mechanic was borderline useless until they changed it (warning: temporarily, so they could come back and make it bad again), and their change made half the bosses and mechanics in the game trivial. Movement speed bonuses turn some of their new mechanics into complete jokes. The 'best' builds are once again turning out to be minion/pet builds because you can let your pets play the game while you hide safely around a corner, meaning the 'best' way to play the game is to not play the game and let the game play itself. The most concerning thing, to me, is that the half the classes aren't enabled yet and it become clear why if you know where to look. Most of the missing classes are melee focused, and melee doesn't work/ The new game systems were not designed with melee combat in mind. The Trial of Ascendancies honor system is the clearest example of that.",2024-12-31 22:35:34,118.55,False,0,0,0,False,True,

You can either be a mighty plebeian worm of various chunks and splatters or a divine weaver of storms! A difficult choice no doubt! This land can be dangerous though, so make sure to stack your energy shields into the stratosphere, becoming impervious to almost any attack! No need for functionally useless stats like armour, evasion, or resistance! They’ve proven to be mathematically useless by our archmage researchers. Some may tell you that the key to survival is to engage with the environment and its denizens, to learn their ways and predict their next moves - do not be fooled my dear weavers of cheese! Those cog headed fools are delirious, as you only get one shot at anything in this land so it is best not to risk your time with anything but the most cheddary thick strategies. You must functionally break the world and weave a destiny devoid of any interaction with anything except your right mouse button. Do not be fooled by the numerous weapons that drop, the staves and wands are our saviours as toiling in the close combat techniques is for the weak minded who wish to die to post death seppuku monsters. Avoid your robes being scuffed by staying a screen or two away from any enemy that dares to be hostile. If you see or smell them you’ve failed my dear sorceresses! While you’re one tapping the big bad bosses with lightning conduits and orbs of storm with your shockingly stylish gear make sure to avoid using any items that do not increase the fatty boons of loot - you will be one of the only classes that can afford to use any! 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 we can’t get enough!! The sweet divine clangs of dopamine will be yours if only you embrace the greed of the storms! This is not a race to greatness my friends…no, this is a casual sail down the rivers of the great material continuum, the gambling simulator that will define the genres of time itself! You can take that extra time you’ve saved by avoiding grinding like a coal miner to consult with the mighty trading oracles provided to us by the gods - outside of the game reality of course, trading in house would be far too convenient. Post your ludicrously over priced goods on the defunct market of randomness, potentially price fix items at your pleasure, or just link your stash tabs to show off with no intention of selling - as you are the masters of this divine foreign land as well! You may have almost no use for divine orbs, but a fatty stack of them makes a perfect nest for you to sleep atop and snuggle with like the wifu you deserve.

184381222,2694490,"It's everything I remember being good about the original, but the combat feels much more engaging. It's not like Diablo or any other ARPG I've played, it feels more like a MOBA control scheme (if you've enjoyed those you'll find a similar ebb and flow through combat). Graphically more impressive than the original as well, though various systems seem to have changed. Fear not! The MASSIVE passive skill tree is still present and still feels impactful. My first character is a a monk and being able to markedly increase his evasion, shield and life gain on kills has made his sustain admirable, and I'm just now starting to focus on damage. Other characters I've played less but have found their trees to be equally engaging. This is a ""pay to get in"" early access period, so many things will change. You are essentially just buying their microtransaction currency though, as you are provided with it to use immediately. So paid ""beta"" yes, but it's fair and it's the same model they used during their early access period with the first game. What I've experienced here is already on par with what I enjoyed about Diablo IV last year. With improvements to come, I think this is another case of PoE being the better game over the more established IP, but that remains to be seen. Whatever the case, I think it's worth your buck if you can't wait for full release. If you don't enjoy supporting these endeavors (or early access/kickstarter/etc) and want to wait, feel free.

184368153,2694490,"I didn't play POE 1 but I did hear it was good. My first real ARPG was D4, and Last Epoch followed so I don't have much experience and I can't compare too much. The game feels great while you're doing the campaign. Difficult but not too much, we can't say it's a ""try-hard"" but you'll need to die and repeat for some parts. I didn't check how much time I took to finish that first part but I would say smth like 30 - 35 hours. When you finish the campaign for the first time, begins the ""cruel"" version of this exact, same campaign. This begins to feel like devs had some lack of inspiration but ok, it's EA, I'll do it because I want to know what endgame feels like. This second run has nothing more to offer me. No challenge at all, I'm running through maps I already know without dying, even for a solo player but hey, honestly I followed some build on Maxroll, so maybe it's just as it is. Bosses melt, so I begin to feel that my character is beefed up. Great, even if it's already beginning to feel boring. When I finally finished the campaign the second time I was lvl 60+ I think. Great, now begins the endgame I was looking for. Except nothing is explained to you. You have to ask other players to understand what you have to do. There's one quest left: Finish 10 ""tier 1"" maps. Not so difficult, I looted the waystones in the 3rd Act, cruel, of the campaign. Some maps can be tedious, some ""challenges"" (altars, in my case) were hell, honestly: I'm playing which, infernalist with some minions, so I'm a little squeechy, I know, but sometime I'm just dying without the time to react (because, you know, you're blocked by some enemy/map item while trying to leave some dangerous zone...). And when you die in Endgame, you lose the map, the ""key"", the loot. You're just back the base, and you need to try again, from the beginning. But yeah, still motivated to see what the game still have to offer. So you make the 10 ""tier 1"" maps, and you got 2 Atlas points, that you can use to get some more Waystones. Okay... Now you have to do 10x ""tier 2"" maps, which I did. Loot just feels unrewarding (honestly it has already been the case for some time, but at this point you just begin to feel it drastically) at this point, you don't loot good items, you don't loot many waystones, and you don't loot the currencies you need to upgrade the stuff you have. So you begin to die more often. Now I have to do 10x ""tier 3"" maps. Okay, so now it's just my ******* job. Clear some maps, to maybe find some key to open other maps, to maybe after the 100 map I clean, find some upgrade I can't ""craft"" because I lack the currency. So yeah, the game is good for like 35 - 40 hours, which is not this bad honestly but after that it's just a job. I feel like I just lost my time because I just don't want to open the game to make the same thing, again and again.

184377172,2694490,POE 2 is coming along very nicely whilst in early access. I've found that its a bit of a slog to level up in single player mode once the initial questing in lower levels is done. I'd personally like to see more bosses introduced into the game as the amount of descent rare/yellow gear components is scarce and at the moment its a real grind to level up a character enough to get past the cemetery level. All the other areas past that are quite a bit harder to transcend unless in co-op mode and I imagine that's harder as well. My suggestion is having very hard perilous levels/areas of difficulty that can be attempted with caution that are not part of the main quest zones that drop impressive legendary gear along with daily/weekly/monthly quests that would help with levelling along with a campaign easy mode along with a veteran and harder modes all the way up to souls-like modes of play.

Achei o sistema de skills zuado e desnecessariamente complexo (você tem que achar joias para criar ou melhorar as skills, e só ganha pontos passivos ao evoluir, numa teia de opções complexas). A dificuldade também é um ponto contra (eu jogo para me divertir, não passar nervoso ou ter que ficar desperdiçando horas em busca do build perfeito. Detesto jogos souls like). E por fim as classes são bem desbalanceadas (umas vão performar melhor que outras). Enfim, não recomendo, mas por não ser algo que me divirta jogando.

184387974,2694490,"Review as a POE newcomer that bounced of POE1 years and years ago Ranged combat feels really good at the moment. Sorc, Merc, Ranger, all feel really satisfying with WASD movement. Melee combat feels worse than POE1 because movement speed is basically a rarity, no QS flask so you're stuck rolling on boots (will complain about gear later) stun threshold is punishing as fuck, and animations are way too slow. Monk feels decent but only because his skills launch him around the screen so you might as well be ranged. Maybe new weapon types fix this but I doubt it. Shield is mandatory for warrior and I think that's bad because weapon switching feels AWFULLLLL swap speed should NOT be a attribute that's dumb as fuck Campaign is good for act 1/2. Act 3 sucks right now because the maps are way too big. You can easily get lost in an act 3 map looking for the exit for 50 minutes. That's just absurd and they need to tune it way way down especially if they're going to be adding more acts to the game in full release. Leveling every league is gonna be complete shit if they keep expanding maps in later acts Passive tree needs more useful nodes on the bottom half. The top and right side of the passive tree are the only parts that feel good at all. Armor, max life, and evasion (kinda) suck so much. If you aren't focusing on energy shields you're literally trolling. 6k life you get 1 shot by white mobs. It's insane??? New skill gem system is so much better its insane. I really prefer it to POE1 in every way. Sockets, links, and gem drops was just an unnecessary headache and they fixed it. Endgame stinks. I never mapped in POE1 so I can't actually speak on it in comparison. My character is the most powerful it has ever been and yet the game is specifically designed to kill that feeling. One life per map is so punishing I cannot believe they chose to do this. So many things one shot you in POE2 (even white mobs! on-death effects!!!!) that you are forced to run maps like a survival horror game. I genuinely couldnt imagine running juiced maps with a titan warrior??? If they gave you a few lives, even 2, I could understand. You go buck wild and risky for your first life and if you die you have to slow down and take the map really carefully. As it stands, you just have to creep along, shitting out skills off screen, and if you kill a mob pack you have to literally run away and wait a few seconds before looting. It feels bad!!! the maps themselves are not good. why are so many so so so so narrow??? There are a lot of times you're on a narrow walkway and a white mob throws bombs down and you literally cannot escape. GG your map is toast. the map design feels at odds with the combat design. Loot isnt good! once you're running maps you're just flipping Magic Find rings and amulets for Exalts so you can go buy your actual upgrades on poe2trade. Uniques are almost all bad, and the rolls on them seems weighted terribly?? Why am I level 82 rolling a unique for like 13 energy shield?? Most rares are pretty bad/useless and crafting basically doesn’t exist. There are like 5 good attributes out of the 10000000 options so using currency to roll items feels like a heavily slanted game out of your favor. I’d rather do sports betting. You’re just better off trading for literally everything in the game. The more I play the more issues i have with it. I think it will take more than 12 months of EA to fix it.

184189558,1144200,"I honestly can't say either I recommend nor not recommend this game with how it is. The single most reviewed part of the game is the enemy AI and how broken it is. I spent 3 hours trying, retrying, using 10+ different loadouts, and different tactics and I still can't even get half of a single mission finished solo because the AI is that broken. They will perfectly target unarmored spots on you bringing up the question of it even worth using armor, will completely shrug off shotgun shells and high caliber rounds on unarmored areas especially the head and arms, and instantly target you making 180 turns the second they're in YOUR fov. The threaten command is also flawed in the fact that it doesn't work half the time. Calling out to civs resulting in them never complying and actually actively walking away until you start shooting at them which shouldn't be the case, armed suspects will do the same if they aren't instant aggro on you pumping you full of 2 mags of headshots. Killing armed suspects shouldn't even penalize you when the entire point is that they are ARMED, they are active THREATS to you, they won't even be surrendering and you'll get penalized over attacking them because there is the precognition of being a THREAT wielding firearms against you. Blah blah blah cry about skill issue, these are straight up glaring issues with the game that you can't even deny exist and get in the way of the quality of the game. I think the devs NEED to improve the AI to not be so blatantly broken and flawed. All of the non-lethal loadout options outside of the grenades are also completely ineffective and don't provide any benefit, maybe if you could shoot guns out of peoples' hands and not get penalized for it they would be better namely the beanbag shotgun or the pellet guns actually affecting the target without wasting a full mag to get the effect to work as intended.",2024-12-30 05:20:11,21.5,False,2,0,0.52,False,False,
184076249,1144200,"Tldr: Good but rather flawed. It's pretty good at what it does. I love the looks in general and the sound design is great. Much gear to try out and many weapons to fiddle with. But it's still rough around the edges and I think you need to spend too much time testing for yourself what works and not, because nothing is really explained and you are left to just assume things. AI teammates are somewhat clunky and stupid, and sometimes they don't follow your commands but you won't know why. The commands also lacks flexibility. But when they work as intended it's pretty awesome. Enemy/civilian AI is... I don't know. Mostly they snipe you from some corner of a window with their uzis. You scream at them, you shoot near them, you shoot them, sometimes they react, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they go incapacitated, sometime they die outright. You taser them and shoot them with beanbags or pepper balls. They might surrender.. maybe. Or they just stand there looking at you for a while first. Supposedly the enemy AI is very complex but that doesn't really show. (yes I have S-grade in some levels, I know what works but that took some major experimenting) There are several other minor issues I've noticed; like the replays don't always save, some keybindings reset every time I close the game, items counters don't add correct value when managing your gear, subtitles are misspelled or using the wrong words (in english), making a headshot sometimes makes the target go bald and change his face preset... Small stuff, but it adds up. Get it on a 50% sale. At the moment I don't think it's worth the full price. I still like it, especially when playing coop with my friends and there are no AI teammates.

184245155,1144200,"If your looking to play a game that could give the common man ptsd then uh well you found it bro great job. I dont think ive ever played another game that gives me a pure adrenaline rush like ready or not. For example I was playing the mission where you had to arrest aa man for shooting at cops as he went into hiding tell me why this ai is able to crawl into little crawlspaces i didnt even realise were there and my team lit hit up as i turned around. Never felt more scared in my life but it shows this games ai is actually hella smart. I cant tell you how many times ive been on edge ready to fire as an ai will pull out a phone ready to take a picture of me, but its not always a phone sometimes they will pull out a gun and you have maybe half a second to react accordingly but thats what makes this game different from every other swat simulator. its slow like literally you cant run in this game but at times you have to react as quickly as an actual swat officer would irl in a real mission. I find it actually very cool the developers of this game put in very touchy subjects like school shootings or full on meth houses no one likes school shootings we all know that but its actually a great way to connect you to what an actual school shooting is like if you dont react quick enough you can slowly hear the other remaining students being shot by the shooters and yes its terrifying but its real at some times almost to real but thats ready or not so are you ready?",2024-12-30 18:52:39,76.72,True,1,0,0.53,False,False,

184473940,1144200,Very excellent game which is a faithful spiritual successor to the likes of SWAT 4 and the old Tom Clancy Rainbow games. I really enjoy clearing rooms and feeling the adrenaline of checking under doors with the mirror wand only to somehow miss the tripwire behind the door and die 10/10 would play again.,2025-01-01 22:36:16,6.58,True,0,0,0,False,False,

184284260,1144200,"This is not just a review but a warning to new players. Ready or Not randomly deletes your progress & game-saves. This issue is known since at least 2023 & it hit me in 6 hours. I am an experienced SWAT player with friends & family that all played those old SWAT titles and we were looking for a new one. I bought it - customized the four SWAT NPCs - you can save the layout & already this was glitchy as suddenly a layout-file was gone (I saved a second ago). Then I played three missions. All with an A+ rating (means I unlocked to 100% cosmetic gear/rewards). But in the 4th mission an arrest glitch happened (you could not arrest an NPC, what is a glitch that can happen- okay for me); I retried - failed, then I stopped, ended the game. But as I restarted the game later - my entire career file was gone, all rewards locked again & while trying to find a fix (loaded MP, load into a New Career) I googled and found Reddit posts & articles that second my experience. Some said it happened to them later in the career, so it seems to be random. I asked for a refund – but Steam goes: ""You exceeded 2 hours & if the game does not save the progress this is no problem..."" This is why I put this up here, so that you do not gift Steam & the developer money for a product that might come with the worse gaming havoc at random. As it does not matter how random or rare the problem is: To write & read a file (a save) should be not a problem in the year 2024/2025 or something a player should worry about. Nobody can want this. I can't even imagine that all devs are fine with this. The game remembered my prior mission-rating (it pops up if you start a new career). Means: It was able to store this information while locking me out from my rewards that came with this mission rating & deleted all saves (gear-layout for NPCs & player/career-progress etc.) for reasons unknown. I only recommend this game to players who do not care about career/customization (unlocking items & such stuff) but want to play a different MP game once in a while with no progress attached. The game-play etc. is all great. I was going to tell everyone: ""It's like old SWAT go & buy it."" Now I will go: ""Don't! As it can be that we have to play Mission 01 20 times to get to Mission 07, without sending save-game files over the net. At least in SP this can happen to you anytime."" Stuff you had to deal with 20 years ago & no Steam. At least know that this can happen. As if I would have known this beforehand I would have never bought this game. I feel ripped off as I donate a lot & have a very small gaming-budget while being a 'veteran'gamer (& modder for multiple titles). Ripped off by a police-game on Steam.^^ What irony. That's why the bad guys shoot at the SWAT teams! They want to protect the money! - Happened to me once, too!^^ I bought this game on Steam; and after I asked for a refund as it deleted the saved files randomly - guess what happened!^^ You have been warned.",2024-12-31 03:31:28,6.7,False,0,0,0,False,False,
